This error was caught and corrected by Dreyer in Scientific Papers of William Herschel.  Struve and Rosse (object Alpha on the sketch of the cluster) later rediscovered it, so it received the second NGC number N4005, this time at the correct place.All major catalogues identify this galaxy as N4005 although you could argue that by prior discovery, III 325 = N4007 should take historical precedence.  In any case, it is clear that N4005 = N4007.  Unfortunately, because of the two degree error the NGC position falls close to N4003.  So, Reinmuth (Die Herschel-Nebel), Carlson's NGC/IC Correction list, CGCG, UGC, MCG all equate N4007 with N4003 ignoring Dreyer's correction.

The main, bright northern component (N4038) was partially annular, with a very bright knotty rim and a darker center giving a truly unique appearance for a galaxy.  At least 3 knots were visible embedded along its rim.  On the south side is the brightest knot which appeared faint, small, ~12" diameter.  A second fainter knot is on the SW side and was only ~6" in size.  Finally, a third very faint 6" knot is on the N side.  The three knots were roughly spaced out 120¡ apart along the outer portion of this tortured galaxy.  Attached on the east end is a long "tail" or arm (interacting companion N4039) that curves around on the south side towards the southwest.  Another very faint, but slightly larger 20" knot is embedded along the main portion of the tail roughly halfway along its length.  At the tip of the main tail was a relatively large, brighter knot that at times appeared double.  Surrounding the SW portion of the tail is a much fainter outer halo extended SW-NE.

Another very faint, but slightly larger 20" knot is embedded along the main portion of the tail roughly halfway.  At the tip of the main tail was a relatively large, brighter knot that at times appeared double.  Surrounding the SW portion of the tail is a much fainter outer halo extended SW-NE.  This fainter halo extends beyond the tail for a few arc minutes and widens to a bulbous shape at the end.  This was by far the most detailed view I've seen of the Ring-tail galaxy.17.5" (5/14/88): this is the southern member of the striking "Ring-Tail galaxy".

This galaxy was discovered on one of the early sweeps which often resulted in very rough positions.************************************************************NGC 4120 = UGC 07121 = MCG +12-12-001 = CGCG 335-004 = PGC 3855312 08 31.4 +69 32 35V = 13.5;  Size 1.8x0.4;  Surf Br = 13.1;  PA = 166d17.5" (3/29/89): very faint, thin, very elongated NNW-SSE.

However JH identified this galaxy as III 480 (N4241) which caused later confusion. In Scientific Papers of WH, Dreyer concludes h1165 = N4241 (repeated by Reinmuth and Carlson).  Harold Corwin argues that WH observed both II 137 = N4223 = IC 3102 and III 480 = N4241 = IC 3115 and that the brighter, western object is II 137 (N4223).  Unfortunately, because of John Herschel's mix-up III 480 was left without a number.  So, modern catalogues identify N4241with U07319 = M+01-31-038 = CGCG 41-065 = IC 3102 instead of N4223.

This galaxy is identified as N4364 in all modern catalogues although there is a probable identification mix-up in the modern catalogues.  See ID notes.Discovered by WH (III 799) along with III 800 = N4362 and III 801 = N4364.  The latter two were described as a "two, both cF, cS, R".  In Scientific Papers of WH, Dreyer notes that "very probably the word 'two' refers to III 799 and III 800 although 3 entries were given in GC and NGC.JH, Bigourdan and d'A only found two galaxies (h1230 and h1231) which JH oriented NW (h1230) and SE (h1231).  Reinmuth also only found these two gx's and listed N4364 as not found.  There are three galaxies here as the NW galaxy is actually a close double (the western component was glimpsed as stellar in my 17.5").  CGCG identifies the double as N4358 + N4364 and MCG and RNGC both identify the stellar western component as N4358 and the main eastern component as N4364.Corwin feels that it most likely that WH only observed a pair of galaxies as JH, Bigourdan, d'A and Reinmuth only picked up the brighter two.  In which case, N4358 =  U07479 = M+10-18-038 = CGCG 293-017e and N4362 = M+10-18-039.  The third galaxy M+10-18-037 = CGCG 293-017w would then be anonymous and N4364 probably a duplicate of N4362.

A mag 6.6 star just 5.5' NW of center is a bit distracting but scores of stars are resolved over the 4' core, appearing to criss-cross the center in numerous lanes.  The outer halo is very large, nearly 15' in diameter, and resolved into a couple of hundred stars.  Except for the brighter, denser core this globular appears similar to a very large, fully resolved open cluster. 18" (7/6/05 - Magellan Observatory, Australia): at 171x, this large, bright globular was an impressive object and beautifully resolved into 150-200 stars mag 13 and fainter within a 13'-14' diameter.  The unresolved background glow was relatively faint for such as a well-resolved globular.  The large 4' core is only slightly brighter and there is no nucleus (class 12 concentration) although a close pair of brighter mag 12.5 stars is near the center.  Scores of stars appear linked in chains and loops, particularly in the outer halo, which is quite irregular and ragged.  Mag 6.6 HD 107947 lies 5.5' NW of center at the edge of the halo and provides a striking contrast although it detracts somewhat from viewing.  A dust lane appears to pierce the cluster on the north side for a few arc minutes (east of the bright star) and this dark intrusion may be an extension of the "Dark Doodad" (see notes). 18" (7/7/02 - Magellan Observatory, Australia): at 228x, this large, loose globular was well-resolved into ~100 stars mag 12-15 with a 12' diameter.  The roundish core is ~4' in size with many faint stars sprinkled across the core.  The halo is elongated and irregular in shape. A starless dark lane appears to wind into the cluster towards the core from the NW side angling roughly NW-SE (later verified on the DSS).

At 100x, the large low surface brightness glow is clearly clumpy with a couple of faint knots evident on the east side of the haze. At 220x, the glow of the galaxy is more difficult to view and several nonstellar knots and a couple of very faint superimposed stars are more prominent. The brightest HII region is N4401 located 2' SE of the core, ~25" in size, with a second smaller 15" knot (N4400) close south. The core of the galaxy appears as an ill-defined low surface brightness glow, larger than the individual HII knots.  A mag 14.5 star is superimposed NE of the core. On the SW side of the core is a third difficult knot, about 15" in diameter (N4399) requiring averted vision to confirm.17.5": faint, very large, extremely low surface brightness, must use low magnification to view.  Three knots are involved (one of these observed "knots" may be the core) within a very diffuse glow.  The brightest knot (N4401) is at the SE end about 2' SE of center with N4400 close SSW of N4401.  A mag 14.5 star is at the N end.

Identification uncertain.JH's position for h1321 = N4512 precesses to 12 32 08 +63 44 (2000).  This position is 10' NNE of U07700 = M+11-15-060, the galaxy identified in all modern catalogues as N4512.  His single description of "pB" certainly does not apply to this low surface brightness galaxy and it is strange that he would not mention much brighter N4521 just 4' NE observed in the previous sweep (described as a "nova" with a 20' error in declination!).Bigourdan was not able to recover N4512 and Reinmuth states "no pB neb found, =N4521?".  His description for N4521 mentions U07700 as a "F neb ssp 4.0" although it is not identified as N4521. Corwin suggests that N4512 may also be identical to N4510 as this would require a 30' error in dec only, although this galaxy is certainly fainter than N4521.  So, the identification with N4521 is tentative.

Uncertain identification.Discovered by JH (h1390).  Described as "B, E.  RA ill observed."  His position is 12 42 15.7 +03 03 32 (2000) although the declination is not stated as uncertain as in the description. Reinmuth notes "not found; N4624 = N4636? (repeated by Carlson).  Corwin notes in NGCBUGS "During the same sweep, he [JH] made a one-degree error in the polar distance for NGC 4636, an error that he himself suggested, and that Dreyer finally rectified for the NGC. Thus, NGC 4624 cannot be NGC 4636 as suggested by Reinmuth and adopted by RNGC."My visual observation described N4636 as only slightly elongated but it is certainly very bright.  Another possibility is N4624 = N4600 which is moderately bright and closer to h's declination.  Instead, Corwin suggests "it is most likely NGC 4665 which JH described as ``B, pL'' in two other sweeps.  This, and the appearance of the bright bar of the galaxy, matches his terse description for N4624, ``B, E.''  In addition, his declination is correct for all three observations. There is a faint possibility that N4624 is N4600, but JH's two observations of that make it ``F, S'' in contrast to his note on N4624.  In addition, the declination of N4600 is off JH's measured dec for N4624."************************************************************NGC 4625 = UGC 07861 = MCG +07-26-038 = CGCG 216-018 = IC 3675 = PGC 4260712 41 52.7 +41 16 26V = 12.3;  Size 2.2x1.9;  Surf Br = 13.813.1" (4/12/86): fairly faint, fairly small, round, brighter core.

The surface brightness is unusually irregular with bright and dark mottling across the surface.  There is no well-defined core but a prominent knot is close following (east) the geometric center along the north side and a second weaker knot is along the west side.  The north edge has an unusually "scalloped" appearance particularly along the west side due to dust and brighter splotches.  The galaxy gradually bulges towards the center and tapers at the tips, particularly along the west end.  A mag 13 star is situated just north of the edge at the geometric center and N4627 appears to hover over this "starship" a couple of arcmin NW of center.13.1" (5/26/84): stunning galaxy, very bright, unusually large and interesting edge-on E-W, 15'x1.5'.  A bright knot is east of the core and a faint knot is west of core.  Appears very mottled along the major axis.  A mag 13 star is just N of the core.

On first glance, it appears the bulging core is offset at the SW end, though with averted vision a very low surface brightness broader extension continues to the the SW of the core for several arcminutes before fading into the background.  The core is very bright and mottled with a bright knot (HII region) jutting out to the west at the southwest end of the core.  The NE extension has a remarkable, fairly bright 2' extension (N4657), hooking to the east at a 45¡ angle from the major axis (the "blade" of the hockey stick).  There is a small, faint, detached knot beyond the east end of the "blade" that appears to have broken off.  The unusual bend and knot at the NE end is a result of a prior tidal interaction with its more massive neighbor, N4631.13.1" (4/10/86): striking!, fairly bright, very elongated SW-NE.

Based on this description I only viewed the core region of this thin edge-on.  Located 1.2' SSE of a mag 12 star and 4.5' NW of the NGC 4724/4727 duo.  The identification is this NGC number is uncertain and most other sources equate it with IC 3834.Discovered by Tempel (V).  Corwin equates this object with an extremely faint spindle galaxy 4.7' NW of the pair NGC 4724/4727.  This galaxy is not identified as NGC 4726 in other catalogues.  NGC 4726 has been identified in the past with IC 3834 (see notes), but Malcolm Thomson feels that NGC 4726 is nonexistent and not equal to IC 3834.Tempel claimed NGC 4726 was discovered 4' N of a double nebula (N4724/4727) whereas Bigourdan's IC 3834 is 38 tsec of RA further E.  Howe's corrected position in the IC 2 notes for NGC 4726 is a perfect match for IC 3834, so he picked this galaxy.

One position was given for both NGC 4878 and 4879 but there is only one galaxy (M-01-33-064) near this position.  Corwin suggests N4879 may be a star about 1.5' SE of this gx.  MCG (-01-33-064/064a) identifies this as a double galaxy but apparently this is a plate defect on the POSS.  Reinmuth identifies a star NE of the galaxy as N4878 and the galaxy as N4879.  Corwin feels this is less likely.

Nearby N5072, discovered by d'Arrest, was accurately placed at 13h 16.6m -12 17 (1950).  So, Swift's position for N5070 is 19 tsec of RA preceding and 2' south of N5072 (accurately placed by d'Arrest) but there is no object at this position.The RNGC has identified N5070 with a very faint edge-on galaxy (M-02-34-023) located 3' NNE of N5072.  Although imprecise coordinates by Swift could possibly account for this discrepancy, his original discovery description provides another solution: "eeF, eS, vf * v close, looks like a D* at first; another nr; 6 in field."  The only galaxy nearby that matches this description is N5072 = M-02-34-022 which has a 14th magnitude star superimposed on the south end causing the initial impression of a faint double star. So, given Swift's description, N5070 should be listed as nonexistent in the RNGC with new description "=N5072."

At 76x (27 Panoptic), barely stands out as a distinct group as it resides in a very rich star field. Includes over two dozen mag stars roughly 11th magnitude. Two mag 8.5/9.5 stars (HD 116721 and 116689) to the NW by 6' and 9' are collinear with the center of the cluster.************************************************************NGC 5139 = Omega Centauri Cluster = E270-SC1113 26 45.8 -47 28 36V = 3.7;  Size 36.324" (4/11/08 - Magellan Observatory, Australia): at 200x in excellent seeing, the view was absolutely stunning as the field was packed with thousands of pinpoint stars to the edge of the 30' field!  I noted the circular ring of stars near the center mentioned previously, but the large number of brighter, densely packed stars in the core and halo, superimposed on an incredibly rich mat of fainter stars was the real show.  The cluster is only broadly concentrated with very large, brighter core ~10' in diameter and the star density thins out very slowly all the way to 35' diameter.18" (7/10/05 - Magellan Observatory, Australia): although I've mentioned this feature on previous observations I was surprised to be drawn to a 1' circular ring of stars just north of the geometric center which is mainly filled with unresolved glow and appears like a darker "hole" near the center.  A second smaller and less distinct 30" ring of stars and darker center is adjacent to the south with the two rings externally tangent in the middle.After the observation I checked John Herschel's description and found these comments on the star rings in the center: "One of these rings, 1.5' in diameter, is so marked as to give the appearance of a comparative darkness like a hole in the centre.  My attendant (J.S.) called up, who saw the hole and darkness, and described it as I have done above. On further attention the hole is double, or an oval space crossed by a bridge of stars. Position of axis = 150."13.1" (2/20/04 - Costa Rica): at 105x in excellent seeing, the view was absolutely breathtaking with wall-to-wall pinpoint stars in the 37' field!  There was a clear 3-dimensional effect with the 11.5-12.5 magnitude stars seemingly floating over a dense mat of fainter stars with the streamers in the halo reaching the edges of the field. I don't recall a more impressive view in the 12" from Australia, where the cluster was higher in the sky. 13.1" (2/19/04 - Costa Rica): In very good seeing early in the morning of the 20th, Omega Cen was a mesmerizing sea of a couple of thousand stars at 200x.  I set Omega just outside the field and let it drift through the field a few times.  The outer halo was an amazingly dense swarm of 12-13th magnitude stars over a background of fainter pinpoints of lights overspilling the field.  Very broadly concentrated to a large, brighter center which is denser although there is no well-defined core.20" (7/08/02 - Magellan Observatory, Australia): at 208x with a 24' field, the cluster overfilled the field with edge to edge stars mag 11.5 and fainter and was a breathtaking sight.  Broadly concentrated with large, brighter core of at least 10' in diameter which is extremely densely packed with layers of stars.  The elongated halo gradually thins but has no definite border out to 30'!  This is the largest and brightest globular in the sky (V = 3.7) and an obvious naked-eye blur, but lacks the strong central condensation of NGC 104 = 47 Tucana.12" (6/29/02 - Bargo, Australia): this was the first object I viewed at Bargo with Les Dalrymple's 12" and was not disappointed.  At 140x, it filled 2/3 of the field (over 25') and resolved into perhaps a few thousand stars down to the center.  The cluster seemed almost 3-dimensional with a lattice of brighter mag 12 stars superimposed on a dense background layer of mag 13-14 stars.  The density was generally uniformly high in the elongated halo except near the edge although the core shows more non-uniformity with a couple of darker patches.17.5" (3/12/88): very large, very bright, fantastic at 220x with several hundred stars resolved in excellent seeing from east of Mt. Hamilton.  Very faintly visible to the naked eye in good conditions near the horizon from northern California.  13.1" (3/24/84): large, mottled disc covered with faint stars, well resolved outer halo.  Similar view but even better resolution on 2/23/85.8" (7/13/91 - Southern Baja): very bright, very large, very broadly concentrated, about 25' diameter, over 100 stars resolved mag 12-13, many in curving streams over the entire disc.

His position 13 28 17 +11 01 23  (2000) is 15' S of U08472 located at GSC coordinates 13 29 13.6 +11 16 33 (J2000).  RNGC and RC3 identify this galaxy as N5162 but it is not identified as N5162 in UGC (08472) or CGCG (072-084) and not listed in MCG.  Due to the large discrepancy in dec, Thomson feels this object is more likely nonexistent.  There is also a mag 13.3/14.7 pair with the faint star to the NE near Swift's position which also matches his visual description.  So, the correct ID is very uncertain.In NGCBUGS,  Corwin states that N5162 = N5174 with a 1 tmin error in RA (too small).  Swift's description "F, pL, eE [not lE as in the NGC]; aneeF * at each focus of ellipse; B * in field sp; F * nr nf'' is an exact match to NGC 5174.************************************************************NGC 5163 = UGC 08453 = MCG +09-22-062 = CGCG 271-040 = NPM1G +53.0156 = PGC 4709613 26 54.2 +52 45 13V = 13.6;  Size 1.1x0.7;  Surf Br = 13.3;  PA = 10d18" (6/21/03): fairly faint, fairly small, elongated 3:2 ~N-S, 0.8'x0.5'.

At 200x using a UHC this amazing planetary displayed an extremely complex morphology.  Through the center is a bright, high surface brightness "bar" elongated WSW-ENE and ~1.5'x0.4' in size.  This central feature has an uneven surface brightness with a mottled texture. A mag 12 star is superimposed just N of the WSW end and the fainter central star is just south of the bar.  A close double star (~3.5") is superimposed just S of the WSW end.  At the WSW end, a spiral extension hooks around counterclockwise to the north and passes through a faint star and then ends at a very faint small knot just north of the superimposed star.  Just south of the ENE end of the central "bar" is a bright 10" knot.  Attached to this knot is another extension that sweeps towards the southwest, ending less than 1' S of center.  About 50" E of the bright knot is another 10" knot that appears detached.  A mag 12 star is ~50" SW of this knot, just outside the halo of the planetary.  All of the brighter features are within a much fainter oval envelope, ~2.5'x2.0'.18" (7/6/05 - Magellan Observatory, Australia): the "Spiral Planetary" is certainly one of the most remarkably structured planetaries and would be famous if located in the northern hemisphere.  At 128x using a UHC filter, a high surface brightness "bar" at least 1' in length, elongated SW-NE forms the main body of the planetary.  The bar is slightly curved and has an irregular surface brightness.  On the NE end is a prominent bright knot, roughly 6" in size.  Nebulosity hooks below this knot, extending below the bar.  Above the SW end of the bar is the brightest superimposed star and a hook of nebulosity sweeps up to the NW, wrapping above this star.  The entire structure is encased in a much fainter oval envelope.  A total of five stars are superimposed including a very close double which is just south of the SW end of the bar and the 14th magnitude central star situated SE of the center of the bar.12" (6/29/02 - Bargo, Australia): this is a bright, strange-looking PN with a complex bar structure dubbed the "Spiral Planetary".  At 140x and UHC filter, it resembles a small barred spiral galaxy with prominent bar extending SW-NE with curved tips, ~1' in length embedded within a fainter, slightly elongated halo of ~2'x1.5'.  A few stars are superimposed.  At 186x, the "bar" is irregular and knotty with a bright knot at one end.  A mag 11 star is at the SW end with a couple of faint stars on the opposite end. The faint 14th magnitude central star is just south of the bar.  Set in a rich star field in the NE corner of Musca 6' NNW of mag 7.2 SAO 252366.  This is a fascinating sight!************************************************************NGC 5190 = UGC 08500 = MCG +03-34-043 = CGCG 101-060 = CGCG 102-001 = PGC 4748213 30 38.7 +18 08 04V = 13.2;  Size 1.0x0.8;  Surf Br = 12.817.5" (5/30/92): faint, small, slightly elongated 4:3 SW-NE, 0.8'x0.6'.

The bright "bar" was elongated SW-NE and roughly 3'x1' in size with a well-defined bright, round core, 1' in diameter.  The first prominent arm is attached at the NE end of the bar and sweeps south (counter-clockwise) on the east side of the core, wrapping around the southwest side and spreading out a bit as it terminates to the south of the core (~3' from the center).  This arm has a high contrast along its outer edge and a couple of faint stars are superimposed near where it attached to the bar.  On the southwest end of the bar a second prominent inner arm emerges and abruptly wraps counter-clockwise around the galaxy on the west side as it heads north.  This arm continues to wrap around the north side before spreading out on the NE side and merging into the outer halo ~3.5' from center on the NE edge of the halo. A more ill-defined third arm also emerges from the core on the south but sweeps more gently to the west (instead of heading north) on the outside of the second arm.  It spreads out and fades into the general glow about 3.5' SW of center near a mag 13-13.5 star.  Offshoots of the main arms are difficult to trace and contribute to the general background glow of the halo.18" (7/11/05 - Magellan Observatory, Australia): in addition to the complex 3-armed spiral structure I was surprised to see a fairly obvious linear bar that extended through the small, intense core in SW-NE orientation.  The fairly tightly wound spiral arm that wraps from the east side of the core around the south side in a counter-clockwise orientation clearly emerges from the NE end of this bar.  The spiral arms that begin on the south and west side more vaguely emerge from the general glow near SW end of the bar.13.1" (2/20/04 - Costa Rica): beautiful view with easy spiral structure in excellent seeing conditions.  The main central portion of the galaxy appears to be in motion, due to the embedded spiral structure and darker ribbons add to this impression.  The three principal arms extending from the galaxy were well seen although they are fairly tightly wound to the main body.13.1" (2/19/04 - Costa Rica): this impressive galaxy was viewed carefully at both 105x and 166x.  The overall size including the spiral arms are ~8'x6'.  The halo is broadly concentrated then rises sharply to an intense 25" core that increases to the center.  Complex spiral structure is quite obvious.  A spiral arm is attached on the east side of the core and wraps around the south side of the galaxy in a counter-clockwise direction.  A second arm is attached at the south side of the core and winds to the west a bit on the south side.  FInally, an arm is attached on the west side and shoots north before gently bending east along the north side of the outer halo.12" (6/29/02 - Bargo, Australia): this was my best view of M83 with a beautiful spiral structure clearly evident with multiple knotty arms.  Well concentrated with a prominent core and very small nucleus.  A very long, spiral arm is attached on the west side of the central core or bar but quickly bends to the north, becoming more spread out and diffuse.  It continues to wind along the entire east side of the halo and fades out near a close double star which is the middle of three collinear stars to the SE of the galaxy.  Two other principal arms are visible - one is attached on the following end of the core and heads south, wrapping clockwise around the core towards the west.  A third arm emerges from the core on the west side and winds clockwise towards the north.  Offshoots of the main arms are difficult to trace and contribute to the general background glow of the halo.17.5" (5/10/86) : brighter arm or arc visible north of the core.13.1" (3/24/84): very bright, large, very bright core, brighter along the central "bar".  The shape of the spiral arms and central bar form the Greek letter "Theta" surrounded by a faint halo.8": very bright, bright core, elongated, impressive.************************************************************NGC 5238 = UGC 08565 = MCG +09-22-082 = CGCG 271-052 = Mrk 1479 =  I Zw 64 = KPG 384 = PGC 4785313 34 42.6 +51 36 50V = 13.4;  Size 1.7x1.4;  Surf Br = 14.2;  PA = 160d17.5" (5/11/02): very faint, moderately large, slightly elongated ~N-S, 1.2'x1.0', very diffuse with no noticeable central concentration.

Just following a small triangle of mag 13-14 stars.  Forms a pair with UGC 9084 4.3' WNW.  N5511 lies 10' ESE (all three faint galaxies collinear).  The NGC identification is very uncertain but if UGC 9084 was misidentified by Tempel as N5482, then this identification from Corwin is plausible.This object was discovered by Tempel in the N5416 group and described in his list VIII (AN 2527).  This is a confusing situation because Tempel's observation appears to place this object 24 tsec of RA following N5482 although Dreyer misinterpreted his description as following N5463.  So the NGC position is incorrect.  The RNGC has misidentified N5469 as CGCG 074-062 = M+02-36-018.  This galaxy is a close companion of N5423 and is roughly 90' from Tempel's position.According to a new write-up in NGCBUGS, Corwin suggests NGC 5469 may be CGCG 074-136.

Curiously, Swift's description does not mention nearby N5652 and N5650 is listed as identical to N5652 in RNGC.Reinmuth mentions in his description of N5652 that "N5650 npp 2.0 arcmin" but DSS shows this to be a single star at GSC position 14 30 53.2 +05 58 58.  The offset from N5652 is 8 tsec W and 15" N, so this star is more likely Swift's N5650.

Bigourdan more accurately measured the position at 14h 53.55m +12¡ 05' (1950) so Swift was off in RA and Dec.  At Bigourdan's position is U09602 = M+02-38-022 located at 14h 53.5 +12¡ 04'.  Further cementing this identification is Swift's description of a "* nr sf" which matches U09602.The RNGC, CGCG, MCG, PGC and NED identify N5782 = M+02-38-021 = CGCG 076-094 located at 14h 52.6m +11¡ 54' (1950).  This much fainter galaxy may have been chosen by these catalogues as it differs only in RA from Swift's original position, although this ignores Bigourdan's correction and Swift's description.  So, the RNGC coordinates should be changed to 14h 54.7m +11¡ 58' (1975) and the data revised to described U09602 which is a much better match.  U09602 is not identified as N5782 in the RC3.

I first took a look in Alvin Huey's 22" to check the relative position and appearance. Then in my Starmaster at 262x I glimpsed an extremely faint, barely non-stellar knot, ~6" diameter, that required averted and was only visible for moments at a time.  The observation was repeatable, though, and confirmed.This galaxy was discovered by Lord Rosse and observed on two occasions (out of 12) close south of N5866. This extremely faint galaxy lies 2' S of N5866, exactly at the relative position shown on the Rosse sketch with respect to the galaxy and nearby field stars.

This galaxy is identified as N5941 in RNGC, CGCG, MCG, RC3, U2000 and DSFG!  These catalogues identify N5942 as Hickson 76d which is likely an anonymous galaxy (not found by Bigourdan).Based on my visual observation of the four members in the group I suggested to Corwin that the identification of N5941 was in error which led to his reassignment of identifications based on Bigourdan who only observed the 3 brightest galaxies (Hickson 76a/b/c). Bigourdan stated that the orientations of N5941/5942 were nf/sp which places N5941 slightly east of N5942.
