Although the discovery positions at the observatory were generally very imprecise due to poorly calibrated circles, Howe corrected the position to 00h 17.5m -22d 48m (1950).

At 212x, the entire 23' field was packed edge-to-edge with pinpoint stars and the blazing, intense core which had a yellowish tint was resolved into a mesmerizing dense mat of stars.  The halo extended to at least 30'.  18" (7/6/02 - Magellan Observatory, Australia): at 171x, this breathtaking globular was viewed at over 50¡ elevation and was stunningly resolved into several thousand stars out to a diameter of over 25'.  The star density steadily increases towards the center.  The relatively small 4' core was blazing and highly resolved right to the edge of a very small compressed nucleus.  A 3-dimensional affect was very strong with layers of stars forming a dense mat over the core.  Many of the stars in the halo are connected in chains and lanes.  The 9mm Nagler does a better job of busting apart the stars in the core, although the cluster overfills the field at this power. The total visual magnitude is just slightly fainter than Omega Centauri and the size slightly smaller, but certainly equal in visual impact.12" (6/29/02 - Bargo, Australia): While at Bargo, I observed 47 Tucana still very low in the sky but an easy 4th magnitude naked-eye blur just west of the SMC.  At 186x, it filled the 26' field with an uncountable number of stars.  Strongly concentrated to an intense, blazing core which was only partially resolved at a low elevation.  The highly resolved outer halo extends ~25' in an irregular outline while the central halo was very symmetric.  This is the most prominent naked-eye GC as so much of its light is concentrated into the central core and it lies in a sparse field with no other rivals other than the SMC.************************************************************NGC 0105 = UGC 00241 = MCG +02-02-008 = CGCG 434-009 = PGC 0158300 25 16.8 +12 53 02V = 13.2;  Size 1.1x0.7;  Surf Br = 12.8;  PA = 167d17.5" (12/19/87): fairly faint, small, slightly elongated NW-SE, weak concentration.

Member of the N210 group.Lord Rosse discovered this object near N210 and described it in two observations made on 7 Dec 1857 and 29 Oct 1877.  With respect to N210, he placed this discovery 25'± south and about 35s of RA west.  The description from 1877 reads "vF, S, lE pf, mbMN, stellar 5' nnf a coarse double star 10-11 and 12m."The precise 1950 coordinates for N210 are 00 38 04.0 -14 08 54.  Using Rosse's offset from N210 places N207 at approximately 00 37.5 -14 34 (1950).  M-03-02-035 is located at 00 37 09.8 -14 30 44 (1950) which is a close enough match given Rosse's rough offset.  Furthermore, this galaxy is also elongated E-W and is located 5' NNW (incorrectly given as NNE) of a wide double star at 40" separation matching the visual description from 1887.  So, the identification N207 = M-03-02-035 is virtually certain.  Reinmuth gives the same identification and notes that IC 41 is 4' N.  RNGC incorrectly identified N207 as nonexistent.

His offset position is about 20" N of a mag 14.7 GSC star at 00 40 59.5 +03 25 59 (2000).  Originally, Corwin identified N211 with this star.  Reinmuth writes "neb or *13.5, *11.8 n 2.7'."  This also refers to the same star.  In NGCBUGS, though, Corwin notes that Stephan misidentified his offset star (actually GSC 0014-1250 at 00 40 43.5 +03 28 05) and when his offset are reapplied they point directly to N203, which was rediscovered later by Copeland.  So, in this case, Stephan deserves credit for this galaxy although it is identified as N203 in all modern catalogues.************************************************************NGC 0213 = UGC 00436 = MCG +03-02-023 = CGCG 457-026 = PGC 0246900 41 10.0 +16 28 09V = 13.3;  Size 1.7x1.4;  Surf Br = 14.117.5" (10/8/88): faint, very small, round, small bright core.

Without a filter at 220x about three dozen stars are visible in the region of the nebula, including a number of faint stars.  At the center of cluster and nebula is the multiple star Burnham 1, a striking triple with a difficult 4th component. A pair of mag 11.5 stars lie 0.9' SW of Burnham 1.The nebulosity responds dramatically to a UHC or OIII filter.  The two brightest regions have a butterfly appearance with the two lobes or wings partially divided by a curving dust lane. A fainter detached portion of the southeast side.  The overall dimensions extend to 15'-18'.  The two lobes are fairly similar in size and surface brightness, though the following section is larger including the southern piece.  The western section has the brightest and most sharply defined edge running along its southern side and oriented E-W.  A long straight dust lane extends along the southern boundary of both lobes and defines the sharp edge on the western lobe.  The curving central dust lane oriented ~N-S intrudes into the nebula on the south side and nearly divides the two sections, though weaker nebulosity connects the two wings.80mm: (2/16/07):  at 13x and a UHC filter, the PacMan nebula is easily visible surrounding the central star.17.5" (9/28/02): the bright central quadruple (ADS 719 = Burnham 1) contains a bright mag 8.6/9.1/9.8 trio at 4" and 9".  At 140x, a fainter companion (mag 10) at 1.54" separation is just visible close following the brightest member and is cleanly resolved at 324x.17.5" (10/17/98): spectacular view of this detailed HII region at 100x using an OIII filter.  This 15' nebulous complex has a mushroom appearance and is separated into three main lobes apparently by dust.  The brightest and largest lobe is following a bright triple star embedded near the center (8.6/9.2/9.8 at 4" and 9").  There appears to be a much fainter detached piece off the south end of this lobe.  Preceding the triple star is a section which is noticeably elongated and irregular in surface brightness fading to the NW.  The section to the north is faintest and separated from the eastern lobe by a curving dark lane.  A dark intrusion is visible south of the triple star which appears to be due to obscuring dust.13" (8/24/84): very large, fascinating nebulosity, very irregular, dark gaps between sections, five brighter stars involved mag 8.6-12.5.  The brightest star is a very close double.Discovered by E.E. Barnard on 26 November 1881 (Sidereal Messenger, Vol 2, p226 and AN 108:369, 1884) and described as a large, faint nebula, very diffuse.  Incorrectly classified as an open cluster in the RNGC (Barnard made no reference to a cluster).  IC 1590 is a large, scattered cluster on the west side.  Barnard's IC 11 was placed 30 tmin W, but Corwin notes that his description "vF, L, triple * on np corner" points to N281 and there may have been a transcription error (see ICBUGS).************************************************************NGC 0282 = MCG +05-03-015 = CGCG 501-030 = PGC 0309000 52 42.2 +30 38 21V = 13.7;  Size 0.4x0.317.5" (10/17/87): fairly faint, very small, round, bright core, faint stellar nucleus.

The identification N331 = MCG -01-03-012 is very tentative.Leavenworth's position in list II is 00 58.8 -02 43 (2000).  The RNGC identifies N331 = M-01-03-039 located at 00 57 04.8 -02 46 12, although there is no mag 12 star 3' NE as in the description.  Originally this object was not found by Corwin, but he now suggests a possible identification as N331 = M-01-03-012 at 00 47 06.9 -02 43 51, although this galaxy is 11.5 tmin W of Leavenworth's position.  This would require a 10 tmin error by Leavenworth (RA noted as doubtful) but this object does match in dec and there is a star 3' NE as in the notes (although closer to mag 14+).

A mag 13 star is 2.2' NW of center.  N335 lies 20' NE.  Incorrect identification in RNGC.Discovered by Leavenworth.  Although the RA from the first discovery paper in AJ, 7, 146 are generally very poor (given to the nearest minute and often incorrect by a few minutes of RA), Leavenworth also discovered N335 whose position is fairly accurate so can be used as a fixed reference.  Leavenworth placed N336 just 9' S of N335 but the galaxy chosen by the RNGC (M-03-03-011) is located 30' S of N335.  According to Corwin who examined the original discovery sketch, N336 is a very faint peculiar galaxy or a colliding pair with three nearby stars whose relative position accurately matches the discovery sketch.  The ESO-Uppsala catalogue lists this galaxy as E541-IG 002 (not in MCG) at GSC position 00 58 02.8 -18 23 05.  This position is exactly 9' S of N335 matching Leavenworth's offset from N335.    E541-IG 002 is not in RC3 or MCG and is not identified as N336 in ESO.  ESO lists M-03-03-16= N366?, but this is a typo and ESO appears to be wrongly suggesting M-03-03-016 = N336.

This star is mag 12, though, and Muller described N343 as mag 16 which does not match.

Forms a very close pair with N343 close preceding, just 24" between center.  At times this object appeared stellar and easier to view than N343, though there doesn't appear to be a faint star close by that I might have confused it with.Discovered by Muller (II) along with N343.  Both objects described as possible stars.  Muller's rough position is 0.3 tmin E and 1.5' N of E475-006 (at GSC position 01 01 35.6 -23 15 54), which is identified as N343 in RNGC and with an uncertain NGC designation in ESO.  I missed it in my 17.5" at 280x on 10/4/97 and at 220x or 280x on 11/1/97.  The exact spot was examined using GSC chart close south of a mag 13 star. It seems very unlikely that Muller could have confused this star with a very faint galaxy.  As an alternative identification Corwin suggests that N343 and N344 may refer to a faint pair of galaxies (Arp-Madrone 0055-232) about 2.5 tmin W (matching in declination) of Muller's position.************************************************************NGC 0345 = MCG -01-03-064 = PGC 0366501 01 22.0 -06 53 04V = 12.7;  Size 1.3x0.8;  Surf Br = 12.6;  PA = 140d17.5" (10/20/90): faint, fairly small, slightly elongated, even surface brightness.

This is the galaxy which I observed as N347.  Marth's position  of 01 01.6 -06 45 (2000) is nearly coincident with a galaxy at 01 01 35.1 -06 44 01 (J2000) which is 4' N of the bright star.  ESGC and Reinmuth also identify this galaxy as N347 and it was observed by Bigourdan: "I suspect an exceedingly faint object which could be nebulous, and which is situated toward 3¡, d = 4', with respect to BD-7¡159."

This galaxy is identified as IC 89 in UGC, CGCG and RC3.  N446 lies 19' WSW and N462 is 30' ESE.Marth's position for N446 is 13 tsec E and 7' N of U00794 = M+01-04-006 which is an unusually large difference.  U00794 is identified as N446 in UGC, CGCG (411-010) and RNGC but not MCG. Corwin suggests a better candidate for N446 as U00818 = M+01-04-012 = CGCG 411-016, which is a brighter galaxy located exactly 1.0 tmin E of Marth's position and which matches in declination.  This galaxy was later placed accurately by Javelle as IC 89 and is identified as IC 89 in UGC, CGCG, MCG and RC3.  Reinmuth also makes the equivalence N446 = IC 89 and gives the IC position.

Incorrectly identified as N449 in the RNGC, CGCG, UGC.This field of galaxies involves several identification problems based on the NGC/IC entries for N443, 447, 449, 451, 453 and IC 1653, 1656, 1661.  The IC listings are likely duplicate entries as follows: N443 = IC 1653 (poor declination given by d'Arrest for N443), N447 = IC 1656 and N451 = IC 1661. Based on the NGC positions, the RNGC has reversed the identifications of N447 and N449 whose correct orientations should be SW-NE.  UGC and CGCG incorrectly identify N447 as N449 = IC 1656 and N449 is identied as IC 1661 in CGCG.  MCG identifies these galaxies correctly.

The star was actually slightly easier to view than the galaxy.Discovered by WH (III 172) along with N553 (III 173) during the problematic sweep of 13 September 1784 which have several identifications questions. WH gave one (rough) position for both objects and described them as "Two. Both vS. stellar, a little doubtful." This object was not found twice by Bigourdan.  Dreyer notes the supposed observation at Birr Castle may refer to another object.  Reinmuth has "not found, = IC 110?; IC 110 = eF, vS, bM, IC 111 sf vnr."

Situated ~30' SE of the core of M33.17.5" (8/11/96): this is a faint, close triple star within M33 described as a "A S neb. or Cl. with 3 st in it" by Lord Rosse.  It appeared as a faint nebulous spot at low power and was barely resolved at 220x.  The trio of mag 14/15 stars was cleanly resolved at 410x.  The maximum separation is 15", the close pair at 9" separation and the other side 12" with the trio forming a 3-4-5 right triangle!  Located 28' SE of the center of M33.This triple star superimposed on M33 was discovered by Lord Rosse on 29 Nov 1850 with a rough position but his description pins it down. "A S neb. or Cl. with 3 st in it.  It is about 8' ssp a [double star] whose components are of the 11 m.  RA 1h 26m +/- NPD 60d 35' +/-.  (I obs)."  The components have a maximum separation of 15".  See NGCBUGS, Corwin.The identification as a triple star was noted by Mayall and Aller (1942) in the article "The Rotation of the Spiral Nebula Messier 33," ApJ, 95, pp. 5-23.  Reinmuth also states "Cl of 3 st 14" although noted as only an ef star (based on plates of M33) in the IC 2 notes.  Corwin gives a mean GSC position of 01 34 44.0 +30 13 58 (2000).  The RNGC New Description is "KN IN 598 ZWICKY", but there is no nebulosity associated with the triple star.************************************************************NGC 0604 = M33-A84 = BCLMP 68001 34 31.9 +30 47 1318" (12/10/07): bright, large HII knot in M33 at the end of the spiral arm that trails to the east on the north side of the core.

A chain of brighter stars begins at the center of the open end of the arc (on north side) and zigi-zags to the N and NE.  A wide bright double (23" separation) sits at the east end of the central region.  Finally anouther fainter linear chain of stars heads to the west of the central region.  Within a 5' region, 50-60 stars are resolved.  13.1" (12/7/85): rich cluster of two dozen stars arranged in an arc.  There are five bright stars including a mag 10/11.2 double star at 9" separation.8" (1/1/84): 10 stars in cluster includes four mag 10 stars and fainter, mottled, over haze.************************************************************NGC 0638 = UGC 01170 = MCG +01-05-014 = CGCG 412-011 = Mrk 1003 = PGC 0614501 39 37.8 +07 14 15V = 13.8;  Size 0.8x0.5;  Surf Br = 12.7;  PA = 20d17.5" (12/18/89): faint, small, oval 3:2 SSW-NNE, almost even surface brightness.************************************************************NGC 0639 = ESO 413-013 = MCG -05-05-002 = PGC 0610501 38 59.1 -29 55 30V = 14.1;  Size 1.0x0.2;  Surf Br = 12.3;  PA = 31d17.5" (12/20/95): extremely faint, very small.

At 25x and OIII filter appears as a fairly faint, round knot with a fairly high surface brightness.18" (10/19/06): superb view at 225x using a UHC filter.  The main bi-polar body was very bright, elongated ~SW-NE and dominated by two large, irregular knots at either end.  The SW knot is brighter and the brightest portion is more elongated in the direction of the minor axis.  Both knots are somewhat irregular in shape and brightness.  A faint star is just off the SW end. The two bright knots are attached with a fainter bridge of nebulosity. Extending off the north end is a large "arm" that sweeps around towards the west and a slightly less obvious counterpart is attached at the south end and sweeps towards the east.  The overall effect mimics a photograph of a barred spiral galaxy or perhaps a rotating sprinkler head with jets of water curving away.17.5" (8/2/86): bright, fairly large, consists of two prominent irregular lobes with a darker center; the SW lobe is brighter with straight edges while the NE lobe has a slightly curved edge.  A mag 13.5 star is attached at the southern edge of the SW lobe.  Extending from the main body of this striking bipolar planetary is a large halo which contains two large outer arms or wings similar to a spiral galaxy!  The outer "arm" attached at the NE end is brighter and longer and curves to the west.  The southern extension is short, fainter and less defined.  The general features described above were clearly seen in the 13.1 at 166x using an OIII filter on 10/10/86.13": SW end is brighter while the NE end is slightly curved.

The position is 12 tsec W of a double star located 5.4' NE of N727 (GSC has a single position at 01 54 11.3 -35 48 17) although h mentions the RA was only roughly taken by a star being out of the field.  The RNGC classification is a galaxy although the position and description "USB, CLOSE DB*?) applies to this double star.  N729 is identified as this close double by ESO.  But Corwin feels it is more likely that N729 is a duplicate observation of N727 which was discovered on an earlier sweep rather than a misidentification with a double star.

On 31 Oct 1886, Swift observed N856 (object 22).  His description "eF, S, lE, F * close" matches the first galaxy in the group in description and position, which implies that N856 = N859.

This puts it 5 tmin of RA following N863 (similar dec) and suggests N885 = N863, assuming a large error in RA.  This implies that Swift reobserved the two brightest galaxies in the group on 31 Oct, namely N856 = N859 and N863 = N885 and additionally he observed this latter galaxy on 3 Oct as N866!************************************************************NGC 0864 = UGC 01736 = MCG +01-06-061 = CGCG 413-066 = PGC 0863102 15 27.8 +06 00 09V = 10.9;  Size 4.7x3.5;  Surf Br = 13.8;  PA = 20d13.1" (9/3/86): fairly faint, oval SSW-NNE, even surface brightness.

Located close north of a semi-circular group of stars and just 2.0' NNW of mag 8.2 SAO 55553.  The identification of this galaxy with NGC 917 is uncertain and this number is listed as nonexistent in RNGC.Discovered by JH (h220) and described as "vF, S, R, forms a semicircle with 4 st." The 5 Nov 1874 Birr Castle observation states "no nebulosity seen, only 3 st about 18-20 mag close together nearly in a line pf." In the NGC notes, Dreyer adds: "h220.  No neb, only a vs, Cl with 4 st nr np (2 Birr obs, 1874-76, not found by d'Arrest)."  Reinmuth found this object "v doubtful? Neb* 14.7 nr Dreyer's place."  Listed as nonexistent in RNGC.DSS shows two very close pairs of extremely faint stars oriented east-west at h's original position (as mentioned in the Rosse observation) but Corwin identifies N917 = U01890 at GSC position 02 26 07.7 +31 54 44 which is exactly 20' S of h's place.  This galaxy also matches his description of 4 nearby stars! Thomson notes it is very odd that assuming N917 = U01890 that Herschel did not mention the nearby mag 8 star but instead mentioned the four nearby faint stars.

Incorrect orientation in the NGC (given as NW-SE instead of SW-NE) although Stephan has the correct orientation in his discovery list.  According to Thomson, N1051 ­ IC 249 (see Catalogue Corrections) based on Javelle's comment.  But Corwin concludes N1051 = IC 249 because Javelle probably confused the superimposed star on the NE end as Stephan's N1051 and thought he had discovered a nova.  Also see discussion of N961 which may also be a duplicate with a 10 tmin error in RA.************************************************************NGC 1052 = MCG -01-07-034 = PGC 1017502 41 04.7 -08 15 21V = 10.5;  Size 3.0x2.1;  Surf Br = 12.5;  PA = 120d13.1" (9/9/83): bright, small, round, intense core.

Situated 2.5' ENE of a mag 11.5 star.  The NGC identification of this galaxy is very uncertain due to poor positions in the group by Marth and UGC, MCG and CGCG identify this galaxy as IC 1846.Discovered by Marth in a group of galaxies with several problem identifications (bad positions or faint stars?).  RNGC and RC3 identify N1109 as U02293 = M+02-08-011.  This galaxy was later correctly placed by Javelle as IC 1852 and CGCG, UGC and MCG use the IC designation.  Marth's position for N1109 is 39 tsec E and 2' N of U02293.Corwin suggests that N1109 may instead refer to IC 1846 = U02265 = M+02-08-006 = CGCG 440-008 (also from Javelle), which is located 2.0 tmin W of Marth's position but an exact match in RA.

The NGC identification from Marth of this galaxy is very uncertain, although it was correctly placed by Javelle (IC 1850).  The galaxy chosen by the RNGC is probably incorrect.Discovered by Marth in a group of galaxies which have several identification problems including N1109, N1112, N1113 and N1117.

I soon realized this was an extremely close contact pair oriented N-S with two tangent knots (described in the professional literature as a "dumb-bell system") just 16" between centers in a very small common halo.  Each component is no more than 15" in diameter with the southern member brighter.17.5" (11/28/97): very faint, small, elongated 2:1 N-S, 40"x20", irregular surface brightness.  On careful examination the glow resolved into a very close pair of extremely small galaxies oriented N-S with tangent halos [just 16" between centers!].  This double system is the brightest in AGC 400 with CGCG 415-040 3.5' SW.The identification of this galaxy with NGC 1128 is very uncertain as Swift's position is 5 tmin preceding.Discovered by Swift (V).  A mag 14.8 star at 02 52 37.9 +06 02 24 (J2000) is very close to Swift's position of 02 52 36 +06 02 41.  His description mentions "2 pF st. close p" and since there is a pair of mag 13.4/13.9 stars at 28" separation about 4.5' W, I initially identified N1128 with this mag 14.8 star.But Corwin gives a possible identification of N1128 = CGCG 415-041 = MCG +01-08-027, which is the brightest galaxy (double) in AGC 400.  If this identification is correct, Swift made a 5 tmin error in RA.  There are a couple of mag 12-13 stars just west of this double system which might be Swift's "2 pf st. close p".This "dumbbell" galaxy is associated with the radio source 3C 75 and each component exhibits a twin radio jet.************************************************************NGC 1129 = UGC 02373 = MCG +07-07-004 = CGCG 540-006 = CGCG 539-124 = PGC 1095902 54 27.3 +41 34 46V = 12.5;  Size 2.9x2.1;  Surf Br = 14.4;  PA = 90d18" (11/18/06): this giant cD galaxy is the brightest in the nearby, X-ray bright cluster WBL 88 = AWM 7 (z = 0.017) which is a member of the Pisces-Perseus supercluster.

I was amazed to find a striking, two-armed barred spiral with obvious bright HII knots in the arms!  At 200x the main body of the galaxy appeared as a bright oval or wide bar ~4.5'x3.5' oriented SSW-NNE with a central bulge.  Emerging from the SSW end is a relatively short arm that hooks towards the NW.  Embedded with this extension is a brighter elongated HII knot, ~30"x20".  A mag 15 star is west of the NW end of this arm.  Just east of the NNE end of the main bar is a brighter HII knot, ~30"x15", oriented E-W.  A faint star (or stellar knot) is less than 1' NW.  This bright HII region is embedded in a diffuse arm that curves gently ESE from the N end of the bar.  After the bright knot, this extension dims but ends at a third bright knot, ~15" diameter, that is isolated the end of this arm (nearly due E of of the core).  This object is on a small list of Starburst galaxies with young globular-cluster-like clusters (SSC's).************************************************************NGC 1314 = MCG -01-09-033 = PGC 1265003 22 41.2 -04 11 12V = 14.2;  Size 1.5x1.4;  Surf Br = 14.817.5" (1/12/02): very faint, fairly small, round, 0.8' diameter.

This showpiece planetary is clearly asymmetric and notably brighter on the NNE side in a sector extending from the center and fanning out to the north.  This brighter region is irregular in surface brightness and slightly dims before brightening along the NNE rim.  The south side is slightly fainter and contains a weaker arc or lane.18" (1/1/08): faintly visible in the 80mm finder at 25x as a dim oval glow surrounding a faint star.  Adding a OIII filter significantly incrased the contrast and the outline appeared better defined.  At 115x in the 18", this unusual planetary is a huge oval or irregular egg-shape, ~6'x4', oriented SSW-NNE (PA ~30¡) surrounding a very bright mag 10.4 central star.  Excellent contrast with an OIII filter which really brings out its asymmetric structure.  The planetary is noticeably brighter in a fan-shaped wedge spreading out from the central star to the north.  At times the NE rim appeared a bit clumpy.  The fainter south side has a slightly darker lane extending to the southeast.17.5" (11/17/01): At 100x with OIII filter, this huge planetary appears a very large oval 3:2 or 4:3 SSW-NNE, ~6'x4.5' with a striking central star.

I was also surprised by the structure in the fairly small, extremely bright core that is embedded in the 3' E-W bar.  On the north edge of the mottled core, a very short, hooking appendage extended towards the NE with a fainter counterpart on the SW end.  This gave the small core the appearance of a tiny barred spiral!  At the west end of the bar a bright arm emerges, dramatically sweeping back to the NNE (sharp 110¡ angle) beyond a mag 12.5 star that is situated near the 1/3 mark of its total length.  The counterpart on the east end of the bar shoots to the SW, reaching a faint star at its end.  The total distance between the tips of the arms is roughly 10'.18" (12/30/08): although a pale imitation of the view from Australia, with careful viewing at 175x the spiral arm attached at the west end of the central bar was faintly visible sweeping to the NNE for ~3' in length.  The counterpart on the SE side was not seen.20" (7/8/02 - Magellan Observatory, Australia): At 127x and 212x, N1365 appeared as an amazing two-armed barred spiral, similar to the photographic appearance.  The core is a quite bright, bulging oval embedded in a larger bar oriented ~E-W.  Attached at opposite ends of the bar are two long, graceful arms which extend quite a distance and are nearly straight.  The arm attached on the west side of the bar wraps around a mag 12.5 star about 1' NW of the core and extends well beyond towards the NNE.  The opposite arm attached on the following end is slightly fainter and shoots towards the SSW.  The tips of the outer arms dramatically increase the total size of the galaxy.13" (12/22/84): bright, elongated core, large, 3' diameter, very diffuse outer halo.

Required averted to glimpse though the observation may have been affected by clouds or contrails.  Located 4.7' W of N1399 in the Fornax I cluster.Due to a poor position by Julius Schmidt (14' due south) with a 6" refractor, this identification is uncertain.Schmidt's position is 03h 36.1m -35¡ 50' (1950).  There is no galaxy here and the RNGC classifies NGC 1396 as nonexistent.  The SGC and RC3, though, identify a galaxy in the heart of the Fornax cluster at 03 36 11.2 -35 36 10 (1950).  This position is 14' due N of Schmidt's location and places NGC 1396 just 5' WNW of the bright elliptical NGC 1399.  Listed as nonexistent in the RNGC.  Based on my visual observation, though, I'm not convinced that Schmidt could have picked up this galaxy with a 6" refractor.Given the size of Schmidt's telescope (6.2" refractor) and other problems with his table, HC feels this object is a reasonable match and the only faint galaxy in the immediate vicinity.  Additional data includes a 1975 position of 03h 37.1m -35d 31', dimensions 1.0'x0.9' and total blue magnitude of 14.8.  This galaxy is in RC3 and SGC but not in ESO.

The RNGC lists this object as nonexistent since no galaxy was found at h's position.  ESO-LV and RC3 identify NGC 1412 = E482-029 = M-05-09-021 at 03 40 29 -26 51.7 (2000), or 40' due S of h's position.This galaxy is a good match with h's description- "F, S, E, gpmbM, 15", has a * south following distance 2 arcmin" as the galaxy is elongated NW-SE and there is a mag 12 star 1.6' SSE.  The poor declination probably resulted from an erroneous digit.

Appears roughly 4'x2', extending SSW to NNE and brighter on the south end.  The west side has a fairly hard, well-defined edge while the east side is more irregular and fades into the background.  Four faint stars are involved on the northern end and a pair of fainter stars are at the south end.17.5" (3/2/02): at 100x, this is a moderately bright, roundish glow, ~3' diameter.  Extends mostly west of a mag 11 star, wrapping around the star, particularly on the north side.  Excellent contrast gain with an OIII filter as it appears bright with an irregular surface brightness.  There is a subtle bite cut out of the nebulosity on the east side that creates a darker hollow extending just west of the star.  At 220x (unfiltered), about a half dozen stars are involved or at the edges.  The nebulosity is quite irregular with a high surface brightness region preceding the star.  Faint, elongated haze extends from this patch to the NE past the star giving an elongated appearance.  A pair of mag 13-14 stars is at the northern end and another pair is just off the western edge.17.5" (12/8/90): at 140x with OIII filter appears as a bright, moderately large, circular nebulosity involving a mag 11 star.

This triple star or asterism is the closest object to William Herschel's position but it's difficult to see how he confused it with a poor cluster.************************************************************NGC 1499 = California Nebula = LBN 756 = Ced 26 = Sh 2-22004 03 14 +36 22.1Size 145x4013x80mm (1/13/07): excellent view in my 80mm finder using a 24mm Panoptic and H-beta as a huge, elongated bar of fairly high contrast stretching across the field.  The glow is generally brightest in the broad middle section between Xi Persei and the 6th magnitude star off the central north side.  The nebula noticeably tapers towards the southeast end as the northern side of this end squeezes inward.  Similarly, the northwest end also tapers as the northern boundary narrows towards the southern side.17.5" (1/16/02): Despite its reputation as a challenging target, this was an easy, fascinating object at 64x with a H-beta filter. The California Nebula is HUGE and extended a full two eyepiece fields even using a 31 Nagler for a total length of over 2.5 degrees and with a varying width of 15'-30', extended WNW-ESE.  The E-W border is well-defined with a filter, particularly in the general vicinity of Xi Persei (middle of three naked-eye stars in the leg of Perseus collinear with the Pleiades) on the southern border and a long straight stretch on the northern edge.  Along the northern edge, there is some filamentary, wispy structure similar to the view of the Veil nebula in a small scope!The nebulosity is weaker and more disorganized, though, close to the preceding and following ends. The nebula tapers towards the eastern end where there are some additional brighter streaks and dark intrusions near a group of stars.  Portions of the central region are clearly fainter with no evident structure.  At the west end the structure is also chaotic with an irregular mix of weak nebulosity and darker voids.  There is much to view here even at 64x, and I spent 30 minutes scanning the entire length for structure. 17.5" (10/28/89): the California Nebula requires very low power and visibility is best using an H-beta filter.  At 82x appears very large, faint, very elongated, irregular low surface brightness with darker lanes and some wispy structure along the edges.  The most well-defined section of the border is near a mag 8.5 star bordering the southern edge.  Located roughly 30' N of mag 4.0 Xi Persei.13.1" (1/18/85): definite contrast gain with H-beta filter as only the section NW of Xi was definite using a Daystar 300 filter (siimlar to UHC), but the H-beta shows the full extent easily.16x80 (7/27/84): very large and faint, very elongated WNW-ESE, sharper and brighter on WNW edge, very low surface brightness.  Improved contrast with an H-beta filter.************************************************************NGC 1501 = PK 144+6.1 = PN G144.5+06.504 06 59.4 +60 55 15V = 11.9;  Size 56"x48"18" (11/7/07): superb view at 450x in good seeing.  The 1' diameter disc is slightly elongated ~E-W, ~60"x50" with a very narrow, brighter rim and darker center.  The mag 14.4 central star was steadily visible.  On closer inspection the thin rim was clearly irregular in surface brightness and slightly brighter along the SW and NE sides with a couple of tiny knots embedded in the rim.  The slightly darker interior was weakly mottled or patchy with subtle variations in surface brightness.17.5" (1/8/00): at 100x, this moderately bright PN was irregularly round, 1' diameter, weakly annular with a faint glimpse of the central star.  There was a good contrast gain with the OIII filter and the image was crisp-edged, slightly elongated SW-NE and the small, darker center was more evident.  Excellent view at 220x with the faint central star (mag 14.4) clearly visible.  The surface brightness was irregular with an unevenly brighter outer rim.  The central star was visible steadily at 280x and the overall surface brightness was mottled or "clumpy" (brighter on W and NE rim), darkening in the center.17.5" (9/14/85): bright, moderately large, almost round, 1' diameter, high surface brightness.  An easy mag 14.2 central star is visible.

Excellent response to UHC and OIII filters.  The surface brightness is clearly irregular with subtle brighter and darker regions.  The SW and NE ends were slightly dimmer, while the NW and SE portions of the rim were brighter.  The region around the central star was also slightly darker.17.5" (12/30/99): at 100x, moderately bright, round, ~2' halo surrounding a prominent mag 9.5 star.  Displayed an excellent response to UHC and OIII blinking while the H-beta filter killed the PN (OIII/H-beta = 12).  With the OIII filter, the surface brightness was noticeably uneven, with the NW quadrant of the rim clearly brighter.  The SE end was also weakly enhanced while the center and ends of the minor axis were slightly darker.  At 220x using a UHC filter, the halo appeared nearly 2.5' in diameter.

This star is 4' WSW of T Tauri and is not involved with nebulosity.Struve's Lost Nebula is part of the T Tauri nebulosity with N1555 (Hind's Variable Nebula).  Discovered by O. Struve in 1868 and also observed by d'Arrest.  Described in the Notes section of NGC by Dreyer as "neb, S, with an eccentric nucleus = *14".  He notes that he was unable to perceive any nebulosity near the place with Lord Rosse's 6-foot telescope in 1877 and not found by Tempel.  In the IC 2 notes and corrections section, Dreyer comments that Struve's nebula was not found by Barnard in 1895 or by Keeler on plates taken in 1899.Modern sources such as Sky Catalogue 2000.0 group N1554 and N1555 together as a single object, although Corwin notes that NGC 1554 is not visible on the Palomar Sky Survey plates.  At the NGC position and Bigourdan's position, there is a mag 14 star.  RNGC incorrectly groups N1554/1555 together and places them about 1 tmin too far E.

At 100x and 140x (unfiltered) an extremely faint haze was highly suspected on the W or WSW side of T Tauri (mag 9) in the direction of a mag 14 star to the west or slightly south (this star is Struve's N1554).  No details were visible at 100x (did not appear as an arc) but a sketch made at 100x exactly matched the orientation of the nebulosity with respect to T Tauri.  Nebulosity was not visible at 220x and no nebulosity was noted following T Tauri.This is the famous Hind's Variable Nebula surrounding the variable T Tauri, discovered by Hind on Oct. 11, 1852 with a 7-inch refractor.  It appears that it was rediscovered by Breen in 1855. The NGC position is correct.  See comments by Dreyer in NGC, IC I and IC II notes section for discussion of various observations.  Also see observations by Burnham in Publ. of Lick Observatory, II.  Modern sources often group N1554 and N1555 (discovered by Struve) together, although there is no nebulosity visible on the Sky Survey surrounding the star at Struve's position.The RNGC RA for N1554 (and N1555) in 1.0 tmin too far E.  The position of the nebula was verified on the POSS (extremely faint on blue POSS but prominent on the red print) and listed in RNGC Corrections #6.  The position stated in the Sky Catalogue 2000 of 04 21.8 +19 32 corresponds with the variable T Tauri (04 21 59.4 +19 32 08, GSC) which illuminates the nebula.

The brightest region is NW of center and contains two stellar or quasi-stellar knoits (super-star clusters) within the glow.  One of these "stars" is fairly easy and the other is occasionally visible.  A very faint stellar object is closer to the geometric center.  The ESE side of the galaxy is fairly uniform though the position angle is slightly offset.  The galaxy lies close S of a mag 9.8 star.17.5" (3/1/03): at 380x this is a bright, very elongated galaxy with an unusual asymmetric appearance, situated less than 1' S of a mag 9.5 star!

Two stellar "nuclei" are visible in good seeing.  The brighter "star" is embedded with the core, possibly just slightly N of center.  A second fainter "star" is close SE, near the edge of the core and is visible intermittently.  These "stars" are actually SSC's (luminous super-star clusters).

Uncertain identification in the RNGC, UGC, CGCG.This galaxy (U03062 = M+00-12-036 = Z393-027) is a poor match with d'Arrest's position of 04 30.2 -00 32 (2000), although Harold Corwin notes "d'Arrest's position quoted in the NGC is bad".  U3062 is identified as N1586 in RNGC, UGC and CGCG but not MCG.In CGCG corrections, Thomson states that this identification is incorrect as very close to d'Arrest's position is a very faint gx, IC 371, recorded by Bigoudan.  But, Corwin claims that Bigourdan's position for IC 371 falls on a faint star. U03062 is by far the brighter galaxy, fits the NGC description of nearby stars but is 13' NE of the NGC position, so either ID is plausible.

Only faint stars were seen by Howe at the NGC position (IC 2 notes).  RC3 identifies N1592 = E421-002 = M-05-11-011 although this galaxy is 27' S (exact match in RA) of h's position.  As h gives a very uncertain dec in the Cape Catalogue this ID is possible though uncertain (not discussed in Corwin's NGC Bugs list).  This galaxy is not identified as N1592 in MCG or ESO.  Listed as nonexistent in Carlson and RNGC.************************************************************NGC 1593 = N1608: = IC 2077 = U03082 = MCG +00-12-044 = CGCG 393-037 = NPM1G +00.0156 = PGC 1544704 32 06.1 +00 34 02See observing notes for N1608.Discovered by Marth (m97).

The NGC identification is very uncertain.Discovered by Leavenworth (II).  Not found by Bigourdan. There is no galaxy at Leavenworth's position and RNGC identifies N1610 = NPM1G -04.0203 at 04 34 13.9 -04 41 59 (2000).  This galaxy is not in MCG, RC3 or ESGC. Leavenworth's position is 1m 21 tsec W and 7' N of this galaxy (not an unusual error although the declinations are generally fairly accurate).  Another possibility is N1610 = N1599 which is at the same declination but ~1 tmin of RA preceding Leavenworth's position.  But Corwin notes this galaxy has a bright star 1.1' ENE which would probably have been mentioned by Leavenworth.HC: NGC 1610 is probably one of the faint nebulae in the NGC 1600 group -- but which one?  There is nothing at Leavenworth's position, and his description (m = 15.5, D = 0.2 arcmin; R, bMN) could match any of the several fainter members of the group.  Among the more likely candidates are NGC 1599, and RNGC 1610.  N1599 is at the same declination and is just over a minute of time preceding the nominal place of N1610.  However, it has a bright star just 1.1 arcmin east-northeast which Leavenworth would almost certainly have mentioned had he seen this galaxy. The RNGC identification is also possible, but is 7 arcmin south and 1.4 minutes of time following Leavenworth's place.  Neither of these options is particularly compelling, but are still worth noting.************************************************************NGC 1611 = MCG -01-12-029 = PGC 1550104 33 05.9 -04 17 49V = 13.0;  Size 1.9x0.6;  Surf Br = 13.0;  PA = 103d17.5" (2/1/92): faint, fairly small, very elongated 3:1 WNW-ESE, large brighter middle.

His very rough discovery position to the nearest minute of RA is 04 51.5 -20 38 (1950).  The RNGC identifies N1692 as a faint galaxy at GSC position 04 52 22.5 -20 37 58 (1950), with a trio of faint stars close south.  The SGC and ESO identify N1692 with the larger and brighter galaxy E552-G21 = M-03-13-029 at 04 53 14.1 -20 38 59 (1950).  Although Stone's position is closer to the galaxy identified as N1692 in the RNGC,  Corwin has examined Stone's discovery sketch and confirms that N1692 = E552-G21 = M-03-13-029.  This places N1692 roughly 2 tmin of RA following Stone's position, a typical error found in his list.  This galaxy is not identified as N1692 in SGC or ESO-LV and identified as A0453-20 in RC2.

At 228x, this LMC globular cluster appears bright, moderately large, round, 1.5' diameter, strongly concentrated with a small bright core.  This object has a very symmetrical appearance with a high surface brightness like a compact globular cluster.

The outer halo, which extends 5' in diameter, was resolved into dozens of faint stars in irregular star chains that appear to stream out of the core.  A single brighter mag 13 star is superimposed on the west side.  The center is highly concentrated with an extremely bright 1' core that appears elongated, irregular and clumpy with a curved outline.  A small, 20" diffuse glow is embedded at the N edge of the halo (open cluster S-L 260).  N1850 resides in a glorious LMC region that is packed with an unbelievable number of clusters and HII regions including N1854 6' SE and a huge cluster and nebulosity N1858 about 10' SE.18" (7/10/05 - Magellan Observatory, Australia): After the Tarantula region (30 Doradus complex), N1850 is the brightest star cluster in the LMC and at an estimated age of only 40-50 million years, this rich, globular-like cluster has no counterpart in the Milky Way!  At 128x, this rich globular-like cluster appeared very bright (9th magnitude), large, round, ~3.5' diameter.  Well concentrated with an intensely bright 1' core.  A brighter mag 13 star is superimposed on the western side of the halo. Several very faint stars are resolved in the very lively halo.N1850 lies in a very impressive region of the LMC (near the outskirts of the central bar) with 13 additional NGC clusters/nebulosity within 30' including N1854 7' SE, N1858 10' SE, N1856 22' SSE and several others including N1836, N1839, N1847, N1860, N1863, N1865.

Nearly two dozen stars were resolved including a distinctive SSW-NNE string that runs past the west side of the core.13.1" (2/20/04 - Costa Rica): at 200x, this compact globular is very bright, strongly concentrated with an intense 1.5' core and a 4-5' fainter halo.  The core is very lively and there are ~30 stars resolved, mostly in the loose halo. A neat loop of stars emerges from the core and runs NNE-SSW along the west edge of the core.17.5" (1/31/87): small bright core, large very mottled halo.  About 20 stars are resolved mostly west of the core.  13" (1/1/84): mottled bright core, not resolved except for two or three faint stars at the west edge.  8" (10/13/81): small, very small bright core, faint halo.************************************************************NGC 1852 = ESO 056-SC071 = S-L 26405 09 24 -67 46.618" (7/10/05 - Magellan Observatory, Australia): at 128x, this rich LMC cluster (possible globular) appeared moderately bright and large, round, 1' diameter.

At 200x this cluster appeared very bright, large, round, with a brilliant core.  At 350x, it was resolved into numerous faint stars around the edges of the intense core.  Up to a couple of dozen very faint stars popped in and out of visibility. The core is noticeably elongated N-S and is surrounded by a large, much fainter halo.  There is a small clump of stars at the NW edge.  The large star cluster and nebulosity N1858 lies 4' SE.18" (7/10/05 - Magellan Observatory, Australia): fairly bright, fairly small, oval 4:3 NW-SE, 0.8'x0.6', moderate concentration.

ESO and NGC list N1854 = N1855.Discovered by Dunlop according to Wolfgang's Steinicke's Historical NGC table.  John Herschel (h2783) notes that "this obs must refer to the general cluster in which the former (h2782 = N1854) is situated as a nebulous-looking knot."  Described as N1854-1855 by David Allen (40") as "seen as a single cluster 2' across, 50 stars notes, possibly some nebulosity."  Listed as N1854 = N1855 in ESO and RNGC.Hartung describes 1850-1854-1855 as a "beautiful field contains 3 star clusters within 12' of each other.  The first in a fine bright well-resolved globular cluster;  7' SE is a small round knot of stars (N1855?).************************************************************NGC 1856 = ESO 056-SC073 = S-L 27105 09 29 -69 07.7V = 10.118" (7/10/05 - Magellan Observatory, Australia): at 128x, this LMC rich cluster appeared bright, moderately large, 1.5' diameter.

At 346x about two dozen stars were superimposed over an elongated glow and many other stars are just outside the glow.  At 200x with a UHC filter, the nebula is very bright overall with a 30" very high surface brightness patch at the N end.  The nebula is brightest along the W and E border and weaker in the center.

N1873 lies 2.7' N with N1871 4.4' S.  In Herschel's first observation (sweep 658), he described this object as "a fine L cluster of scattered stars which fills the field.  The point taken is the middle of 3 groups [including N1871 and 1873] in the most condensed part."  So, he was referring to the entire field as N1869.  Located 11.5' S of mag 4.9 Theta Doradus.Discovered by JH (h2798) along with N1871 and N1873.  N2000, ESO and Morel's Visual Atlas of the LMC all identify N1869 with a small cluster flanked by N1871 to the S and N1873 to the N at JH's position.  JH's description for h2798 reads: "cluster a 7th class; a fine L cluster of sc st which fills field.  The point taken is the middle of 3 groups in the most condensed part."Jenni Kay notes that "I am confident the small cluster centrally positioned between N1871 and N1873, being 2.5' in size is not JH's cluster.  The whole star group is attractive enough to warrant it's own designation. ...the small OC was used to measure a position only for the whole group which is the true N1869 JH cluster.************************************************************NGC 1870 = ESO 056-SC081 = S-L 31705 13 10.9 -69 07 03V = 11.3;  Size 1.1x1.024" (4/5/08 - Magellan Observatory, Australia): at 200x this cluster (globular?) appeared very bright, small, round, at most 30" in diameter.

The group is elongated NW-SE, ~10'x4' in size, although the borders of the group are arbitrary.  Includes 10 brighter mag 10-12 stars.  The declination given in the RNGC is 9 degrees too far south (listed as nonexistent).Observed three times by WH (VIII 4): "A Cl of co and i sc pLst." and once by JH (h353).  At their position is a scattered group of bright stars which is probably an asterism.  There was a misprint in the declination in GC and NGC of 9 degrees south.   Listed as nonexistent in RNGC which gives the erroneous NGC position.  Lynga does not list an object at H's position and Reinmuth also adds "no distinct Cl."

Contains an intense, 1' core which is mottled and partially resolved, particularly around the edges.  The halo is easily resolved with several dozen brighter members peppered within the halo and around the periphery (~40 stars counted) although there are no dense knots.  Surrounding the inner core (nucleus) is a dense ring of high surface brightness which is very mottled.  In good moments of seeing this ring breaks up into a swarm of stars.  Located 40' ENE of 5th magnitude h3752, which is a striking mag 5.5/6.7 pair at 3".17.5" (1/9/99): at 280x, this globular is well resolved into several dozen stars.

The background haze drops off significantly towards the outer portion of the halo but a number of brighter stars are resolved including a nice arc of stars along the following edge of the halo.  A evenly matched close pair is on the NE side and a mag 12 star is at the N edge.  Located 35' NE of naked-eye 5th magnitude h3752 (5.5/6.7 at 3").17.5" (12/8/90): 40-50 stars resolved mostly in halo or at the edge of the very mottled core.

At 200x, roughly 100 stars mag 11-15 were resolved in a 7' region with some extensions increasing the diameter another couple of arc minutes.  S Dor is the brightest star in the main portion of the cluster, though there are several mag 12 stars.  On the north side is a small, bright knot (S-L 360) that is clearly non-stellar and surrounded by a thin, fainter halo (ring of faint stars on DSS).The cluster is embedded in a very large, bright emission nebula (LMC N119).  The most prominent section of the nebula is a very bright 3' patch to the east of S-L 360 and a wing to the south of S-L 360 that responds well to a UHC filter at 200x.  Nebulosity is also visible on the west side of S Dor.  This section curves N-S to S-L 360 and also south of S Dor.  To the south of N1910, on a NW to SE stream extending a couple of degrees, are dozens of LMC clusters with N1903, an impressive globular, situated 10' SW.************************************************************NGC 1911 = N1920?05 20 33.0 -66 46 44See observing notes for N1920.JH's position for h2826 is 05 19 13 -66 45.8.  This is 5' S of the E85-SC70 which is identified as N1911 in ESO. But no clustering visible on GSC or DSS at this position!   Listed as nonexistent in RNGC.

On the south edge is a small triangle of mag 13-14 stars (12"-15" on each side) and another three stars within the cluster are resolved.  The cluster is involved an elongated bright nebulous glow NNW to SSE and at 350x additional nebulosity surrounds the main glow for a total size of 1.5'x1.0'.  A mag 11.7 star lies 1.7' E and a mag 10 star 2.2' SW.

At 200x a striking double star sits within the glow with a third star in a line and an additional 20 stars are resolved in the cluster.  These stars are immersed in a diffuse nebulous glow that responds well to a UHC filter.  The brightest section is a patch to the east of the double star (LMC N120C), but nebulosity extends throughout the cluster as an elongated glow of ~5' length.  On images this nebula appears more like an arc or rim with some filamentary structure.************************************************************NGC 1920 = ESO 085-EN074 = LMC N3805 20 33.0 -66 46 4413.1" (2/20/04 - Costa Rica): this LMC HII region appeared fairly faint, fairly small, round, 35" diameter, smooth glow.

Two mag 11 stars aligned WNW-ESE  lie 2' NNE and 3' NNW.************************************************************NGC 1934 = ESO 056-SC109 = LMC N44B05 21 48 -67 56 3024" (4/7/08 - Magellan Observatory, Australia): this is a locally brighter patch in the N1929-34-35-36-37 complex, situated very close NW of N1935.  This patch is not as well defined as the other NGC objects in this bright HII complex but is noticeable as it involves a couple of brighter stars.************************************************************NGC 1935 = ESO 056-EN110 = LMC N44B = IC 212605 21 59 -67 57 2924" (4/7/08 - Magellan Observatory, Australia): this emission glow forms the NW pair with N1936 in a very striking field of clusters and HII patches.  At 200x and UHC filter it appeared as a very bright, round glow of uniform high surface brightness.  The size is slightly smaller than N1936, perhaps 45"-50" in diameter.  Good response to the UHC filter.  Nebulosity also extends off to the NW of N1935 and a locally brighter patch (N1934) involves a couple of brighter stars.  Superimposed on this entire complex of HII knots is a rich concentration of stars.************************************************************NGC 1936 = ESO 056-EN111 = LMC N44C = IC 212705 22 12.6 -67 58 3224" (4/7/08 - Magellan Observatory, Australia):  N1936 appeared as a very bright, round glow, ~1' diameter with a very high, uniform surface brightness at 200x using a UHC filter.  Situated at the south end of a large cluster and HII complex.  Additional fainter nebulosity sweeps to the south and is connected with a fainter (anonymous) patch to the west by 1'.  This extension increases the total size to 2' to 2.5'.  N1935 lies 2' NW************************************************************NGC 1937 = ESO 056-SC112 = LMC N44I05 22 29 -67 53.724" (4/7/08 - Magellan Observatory, Australia): this object is the furthest NE in a gorgeous field of stars and HII regions.  N1937 is a large nebulous patch, ~3.7'x2.7' in size, with ~20 stars resolved over the bright glow.  Excellent contrast gain using a UHC filter at 200x.  The cluster includes a string of stars oriented WSW-ENE that passes through the center including a mag 11 star.  N1936, a very bright nebulous glow, lies 5' S, and other sections of the N44 superbubble complex (see http://www.universetoday.com/am/publish/gemini_interstellar_cavern.html) lie to the SW including N1929, N1935 and IC 2126.  Superimposed on this complex of HII glows is a fairly rich concentration of stars.************************************************************NGC 1940 = ESO 085-SC078 = S-L 42705 22 44.2 -67 11 10Size 0.113.1" (2/20/04 - Costa Rica): faint, very small, round, 20" diameter.  No resolution.  Cradled by three mag 10-11 stars 1.2' S, 1.1' E and 1.5' E.  Located 52' E of mag 4.8 Theta Doradus in the LMC.************************************************************NGC 1941 = ESO 085-EN079 = LMC N4605 23 07.4 -66 22 4113.1" (2/20/04 - Costa Rica): faint, very small, round, 15" diameter.

Within the brighter 2' core is a sharply concentrated brighter nucleus.  This is an impressive S0 or E-galaxy at 200x due to the high surface brightness core and several brightness levels.  On images, the disc is bisected by an equatorial dust lane similar to Centaurus A, though this feature wasn't noticed.Discovered by JH (h2855).  JH's dec is 1 degree south of E085-087 although this identification is certain.  In a paper on LMC clusters, Kontizas et al incorrectly lists KMH90-878 = N1947 probably because of this 1 deg error in NGC, although there does not appear to be a cluster on GSC or DSS at the Kontizas position.************************************************************NGC 1948 = ESO 085-SC85 = S-L 45805 25 51.0 -66 15 51V = 11.6;  Size 624" (4/11/08 - Magellan Observatory, Australia): this is a large, well-resolved star cloud, ~6' diameter, with a roughly diamond shape.  Approximately 60 stars were resolved at 260x over haze.  A fairly large, nebulous knot (LMC N48B) was visible on the SW side, ~1.2' diameter, and it responded well to a UHC filter.  A couple of other very small knots or clumps of stars were visible at the center (LMC N48A and N48C).  Supernova remnant LMC N49 lies 11' NNE.13.1" (2/20/04 - Costa Rica): at 105x this is a fairly large star group in the LMC.  Over a dozen mag 12-13 stars are resolved in a triangular group, ~6' diameter, over unresolved background haze or possibly nebulosity.  The bright, "blue globular", N1978, lies 18' E.************************************************************NGC 1950 = ESO 056-SC116 = S-L 45005 24 33.0 -69 54 04V = 13.2;  Size 1.724" (4/7/08 - Magellan Observatory, Australia): this is the first in a group of clusters including N1958, 59, 69, 71, 72 and 86.  These clusters reside in a dense part of the LMC bar.  N1950 forms the SW vertex of a triangle with N1959 5.5' ESE and N1958 6.3' NE.  At 260x it appeared moderately bright, fairly large, ~2' diameter, with a relatively low surface brightness.  At 346x, several extremely faint stars pepper the surface of the cluster.  A mag 11 star lies 3' E, within the triangle described above.************************************************************NGC 1951 = ESO 085-SC086 = S-L 46405 26 06.4 -66 35 50V = 10.6;  Size 1.913.1" (2/20/04 - Costa Rica): fairly bright, small, round, 25" diameter, well-concentrated with a 10" bright core (John Herschel notes this is a close double star).************************************************************NGC 1952 = M1 =  Crab Nebula = LBN 833 = Sh 2-244 = Taurus A = SNR 184.6-5.805 34 32.0 +22 00 52V = 8.5;  Size 6x418" (2/23/06): at 225x the shape was quite elongated and irregular and the interior had a turbulent appearance due to a very irregular surface brightness.  The periphery has a tattered or ragged edge and changes shape somewhat with averted vision.  With a UHC filter, there is a brighter knot (sometimes appears as an extended, elongated feature) near the SW edge.  Easily visible as a faint, oval patch in 15x50 IS binoculars.17.5" (2/8/86): very bright, unusual potato shape with an irregular surface brightness, 6'x4', broad concentration towards center.  Very irregular elongated shape with extensions or "arms" towards the NW and SE, ragged edges at periphery.  A large dark indentation or "bay" intrudes on the NE side of the SE extension, so this end is thinner and less prominent.  A few faint stars are superimposed.  Using an OIII filter, the overall structure is muted but a bright inner streak is visible in the SW quadrant (oriented ~E-W) and this streak is not noticeable without the filter. 13.1" (1/18/85): large, bright, irregular potato shape, large indentation on following end.  Easy in 16x80 finder.8" (10/4/80): moderately bright, irregular shape, fairly large, indentation on the NW and SE ends.************************************************************NGC 1953 = ESO 56-SC118 = S-L 45905 25 28.0 -68 50 18V = 11.7;  Size 1.224" (4/7/08 - Magellan Observatory, Australia): at 200x, this LMC globular appeared bright, moderately large, round,~50" diameter, with a brighter core.  At 350x, it was grainy with a couple stars easily resolved at the edges of the halo.  The nucleus appears offset from center towards the E.  The interesting N1962-65-66-70 HII complex and cluster follows with N1970 4.5' due E and stretching quite a distance to the E and SE lie a huge number of clusters, star clouds and HII regions.************************************************************NGC 1954 = MCG -02-15-003 = NPM1G -14.0248 = PGC 1742205 32 48.3 -14 03 45V = 11.8;  Size 4.2x2.0;  Surf Br = 14.0;  PA = 155d17.5" (12/3/88): faint, small, slightly elongated, bright core, faint stellar nucleus.

Sharply concentrated with a small, round bright core and much fainter extensions WSW-ENE.  A faint star is just beyond the SW tip.  This galaxy has an absorbtion lane (dust) along the north side, although this feature was not noted.************************************************************NGC 1957 = NPM1G -14.0249 = PGC 1742705 32 55.1 -14 07 58V = 13.9;  Size 1.1x0.8;  Surf Br = 13.617.5" (12/3/88): very faint, very small, round, weak concentration.  Located 5' SSE of N1954.Leavenworth's rough position (list I) is correct.  This galaxy is not listed in RC3 or MCG. RNGC position may simply be copied from NGC as listed as type 0, unverified southern object.************************************************************NGC 1958 = ESO 056-SC119 = S-L 46205 25 30.7 -69 50 10V = 13.0;  Size 1.524" (4/7/08 - Magellan Observatory, Australia): at 260x, this LMC cluster appeared bright, fairly small, round, 45" diameter.  Increasing the magnification to 346x, resolved the cluster into a couple of dozen very faint, densely packed stars.  The 1' halo appeared irregular and mottled as if more stars were just below resolution.  A number of clusters are nearby and N1958 forms the northern vertex of an isosceles triangle with N1959 5.5' S and N1950 6.3' SW.  A single brighter mag 11 star sits within this triangle at the vertex of another isosceles triangle with N1959 and N1950.************************************************************NGC 1959 = ESO 056-SC120 = S-L 46605 25 35.7 -69 55 36V = 12.2;  Size 1.624" (4/7/08 - Magellan Observatory, Australia): this globular is at the SE corner of a triangle of clusters with N1958 5.5' NNW and N1950 6' WNW.  It appears similar to N1950 -- a moderately bright, fairly large glow of ~2' but with a relatively low surface brightness.  Appears slightly smaller than N1958.  At 346x, a few faint stars are resolved around the edges.************************************************************NGC 1960 = M36 = Cr 7105 36 18 +34 08.5V = 6.0;  Size 1218" (1/17/09): at 175x roughly 175 stars are resolved in the central 10' but irregular extensions increase the halo to closer to 20' and includes roughly 250 stars.  Many of the stars are arranged in long curving strings as well as one very distinctive curving loop on the SE side of the core with a pretty double (·737 = 8.5/9.0 at 11") with a fainter third companion at the NW end of the loop.  The cluster itself is pretty symmetrical with a dense 10' core and the brighter stars are sprinkled about fairly uniformly.8": very bright, large, loose, includes two curving star lanes.  The double star ·737 = 8.5/9.0 at 11" is near the center.************************************************************NGC 1961 = UGC 03334 = MCG +12-06-007 = CGCG 329-008 = Arp 184 = IC 2133 = PGC 1762505 42 04.4 +69 22 46V = 11.0;  Size 4.6x3.0;  Surf Br = 13.7;  PA = 85d17.5" (12/8/90): moderately bright, moderately large, elongated 2:1 E-W, weak concentration, small bright core.  A mag 13 star is 30" SSE of center and a mag 12 star is just off the W edge 2.4' from center.  Appears to have a dark patch between this star and the core.  Forms a pair with CGCG 329-011 7.6' NE (not seen).8" (10/13/81): faint, moderately large, bright core, diffuse, elongated, star involved.Discovered by WH (III 747).  There was an erroneous reduction of Herschel's position in NGC (noted by Dreyer in 1912 NGC Correction list).  The correct position for this galaxy (U03334 = M+12-06-007 = Arp 184) was later given by Bigourdan and received the number IC 2133.  See NGCBUGS.************************************************************NGC 1962 = ESO 056-SC12205 26 18 -68 50.324" (4/7/08 - Magellan Observatory, Australia): N1962 forms the bright western patch of the N1962-65-66-70 cluster and emission nebula.  At 200x it appeared as a large, fairly bright glow on the west side of the complex, ~2' in diameter.  A few faint stars are peppered across the glow.  Excellent contrast gain using the UHC filter which increased the visibility to a prominent glow.  Globular cluster N1953 lies 4.5' W and a large number of additional clusters that I didn't have time to explore lie to the S and SE.************************************************************NGC 1963 = ESO 363-SC00505 32 10.8 -36 22 5117.5" (2/22/03): at 100x, a distinctive looping group of two dozen mag 10-13 stars which is likely an asterism.  Roughly 10' diameter with a string of stars on the south side trailing to the east.  Includes several mag 10-11 stars with two mag 8 stars (oriented N-S) on the N side of the low power field.  Described by John Herschel as forming a "3" shape.  Listed as a nonexistent cluster in the RNGC and as IC 2135 in NGC 2000.0 which is located about 12' following.Discovered by JH (2861) and described as "the cusp of a cluster of stars, 8...11m; arranged pretty exactly in a figure of 3 with appendages.  *8 in cusp taken."  This group of stars stands out fairly well on GSC although the brightest star is closer to mag 10.Incorrectly identified in RC 3 and N2000 as the galaxy IC 2135 with major axis 3.5', although JH's description below clearly refers to a group of stars and his position corresponds with a mag 11.0 GSC (his mag is too bright) at 05 32 10.8 -36 22 51 (2000) in the center of the group.

A mag 13.5 star is at the W edge 0.7' from center and a mag 14 star is at the SSW edge of the major axis 1.2' from center.  Located just SW of a thin triangle of mag 9.5-10.5 stars, the closest being mag 9.3 SAO 170546 1.7' NW of center.13" (12/18/82): faint, elongated, small bright nucleus, fairly small, faint halo surrounded core.************************************************************NGC 1965 = ESO 056-SC123 = LMC N144B05 26 29.5 -68 48 23V = 11.024" (4/7/08 - Magellan Observatory, Australia): this is a bright, small knot on the NW side of a large HII complex and cluster that includes N1966 (1.5' ESE), N1962 (2.2' SW) and N1970.  N1965 surrounds two stars and is ~20" in diameter with a fainter nebulous halo.************************************************************NGC 1966 = ESO 056-SC125 = LMC N144A  05 26 46 -68 48 49Size 13x1224" (4/7/08 - Magellan Observatory, Australia): this number refers to one of the multiple components of a large star cluster and HII complex, ~5' in diameter.  At 346x this is a small, bright glow on the NE side that surrounds three stars, elongated WNW-ESE, ~40"x15".  Fainter nebulosity is attached extending to the west for 1.5' and connecting to the knot N1965.  A mag 9.9 star lies 1.2' S.  This HII complex is located roughly 12' S of a mag 6.1 star (6.7/7.0 pair at a close 1.4").At 200x using a UHC filter, this is a fascinating emission complex as the entire 5' region is awash in bright nebulosity and there are faint, irregular extensions beyond the main portion, particularly to the north (the outer portions form a faint bubble on images).  A 10th mag star is involved, though the cluster itself (S-L 476) does not stand out significantly.John Herschel referred to N1966 in one observation as "the third of a group of 4 nebulae" (referring to this knot) but also as "a pL irreg cluster" centered on the mag 10 star mentioned above.  So, N1966 is sometimes applied to the small knot described above or the entire complex (by Henize).  This listed dimensions reflect the entire complex.************************************************************NGC 1969 = ESO 056-SC124 = S-L 47905 26 33 -69 50 27V = 12.5;  Size 1.224" (4/7/08 - Magellan Observatory, Australia): this is the first in a compact right triangle of clusters with N1971 1.2' SE and N1972 1.4' E.  At 260x it appeared moderately bright, fairly small, round.  This cluster has a lower surface brightness than N1971 and N1972.

The surrounding nebulosity is not more evident than the general glow of the complex.  Perhaps Herschel was referring to a different knot in the complex.  ************************************************************NGC 1971 = ESO 056-SC128 = S-L 48105 26 45.6 -69 51 03V = 11.9;  Size 1.1x0.9524" (4/7/08 - Magellan Observatory, Australia): this cluster is the furthest south in a small right triangle of clusters with N1969 1.2' NW and N1972 0.9' NNE.  At 260x it appeared bright, fairly small, round, 45" diameter (largest of trio), gradually increases to the center.  At 350x, it contains a sharp stellar core or a mag 14 star is superimposed and a star is also on the SE edge.

At 260x this small cluster is bright, round, ~35" diameter (smaller than N1971).  There is either a very small knot of stars at the E edge (DSS reveals an apparent close double star).************************************************************NGC 1973 = Ced 55b = Sh 2-27905 35 04.8 -04 43 55Size 5x513.1": extensive bright nebulosity including N1975 and N1977, very large, elongated ~E-W.

The remarkable structure is difficult to describe but includes bays, filaments, knots, nebulous stars and a huge outer loop.  Definite colors are visible including pale greens and pinks.  Highlighted by the Trapezium which contains six stars and appears to reside in a darker hollow.  The bright portion surrounding Theta probably has the highest surface brightness of any HII region in the sky with an "electric" appearance.  Dark streaks and a dark wedge = "fish's mouth" intrudes on the NE side.  Using an H-Beta filter, the nebulosity significantly dims in general but there is one outer wing or loop on the W side (oriented N-S) which obviously increases in contrast with the filter!************************************************************NGC 1977 = Ced 55e = Sh 2-279 = "Running Man" Nebula05 35 15.8 -04 50 40Size 20x1013.1": see description for N1973.

This small, circular nebula is visible without a filter.Incorrectly listed as a planetary in the RNGC because it was catalogued as a planetary in the Kohoutek's CGPN.************************************************************NGC 1986 = ESO 056-SC134 = S-L 48905 27 37.7 -69 58 14V = 11.1;  Size 2.8x2.424" (4/7/08 - Magellan Observatory, Australia): at 260x, this LMC globular appeared very bright, fairly large, round, at least 2' diameter, with a bright core and several faint stars resolved.  At 346x, at least a couple of dozen stars were resolved in the fainter halo and over the disc.  There is a brighter elongated bar in the central portion (reminiscent of M4).  Located 7.5' NE of a mag 8 star (HD 36598).  A very faint cluster, H-S 307 lies 4.8' NNE and a very small trio of clusters, N1969-71-72 lies ~9' NW.  N1959 is a bit further away at 11' WNW with N1950 continuing on the same line 16.5' WNW.  All of these clusters are visible in the same 30' field of the 13mm Ethos at 200x.************************************************************NGC 1989 = ESO 423-021 = MCG -05-14-004 = PGC 1746405 34 23.4 -30 48 04V = 13.1;  Size 1.4x1.1;  Surf Br = 13.5;  PA = 106d17.5" (12/3/88): faint, very small, slightly elongated, broad concentration.  Situated at the vertex of two converging rows stars including mag 9.6 SAO 19574 3' NNE and mag 9.4 SAO 195974 5.5' NNE.  Forms a pair with N1992 6' SSE and brightest in cluster ACO S536.************************************************************NGC 1992 = ESO 423-023 = MCG -05-14-007 = PGC 1746605 34 31.9 -30 53 49V = 13.7;  Size 1.0x0.7;  Surf Br = 13.2;  PA = 45d17.5" (12/3/88): extremely faint, small, very low surface brightness.  Forms a pair with N1989 6' NNW in ACO S536.************************************************************NGC 1993 = ESO 554-014 = MCG -03-15-003 = PGC 1748705 35 25.5 -17 48 55V = 12.4;  Size 1.5x1.4;  Surf Br = 13.1;  PA = 80d17.5" (12/3/88): fairly faint, very small, round, very small bright core.  Located 40' E of Alpha Leporis (V = 2.6).************************************************************NGC 199605 38 10.2 +25 49 02Size 20x1018" (11/6/04): at 73x (31 Nagler), this is a moderately rich group of ~60 stars mag 11-14 in a large, elongated group, perhaps 17'x8', extended N-S.  The majority of the stars are ~12th magnitude.  A string of 10th magnitude stars heads SE for 15'.  Situated in a rich star field ~20' W of mag 5.2 HD 37438 (125 Tauri).  This cloud stands out reasonably well at low power but would not be distinguishable at higher power.  Listed as nonexistent in the RNGC.Discovered by WH (VIII 42): A cluster of course scattered stars above 15' dia.  The stars nearly of a size and equally scatterered."  Reinmuth describes this group as 17'x12' in PA 10, "Cl, L, E, pP, sc, st 11..."  The GSC appearance agrees with this description and the group is between two mag 5-6 stars at 40' separation E-W.  Listed as nonexistent in RNGC. See NGCBUGS.************************************************************NGC 1999 = LBN 979 = Ced 55i = PP 3405 36 25.3 -06 42 57Size 2x218" (2/24/06): spectacular view at 565x.  The bright mag 10.5 central star appears slightly offset east of center, though this may be an optical affect due to the Bok globule on the west side.  The bright, 2' reflection nebula is slightly brighter just following the central star.  The irregular dark vacuity is large and detailed at this power and appears anvil-shaped.  The base of the anvil is along the western side and oriented N-S.  There is a narrow extension to the south that tapers to a wedge.  Along the north side, the globule extends to the east and partially wraps around the central star.  This was the first time I've seen the globule take on an appearance similar to the well-known HST image. 17.5" (2/22/03): remarkable, bright 2' reflection nebula surrounding mag 10.5 V380 Orionis (emission-line star).  At 220x, a prominent, curving dark patch or globule wraps around the star along the west side.  Two of the brightest Herbig-Haro objects are close south, with HH 2 lies 4.3' due south and fainter HH 1 2.5' is SSW.17.5" (2/8/90): bright, high surface brightness emission nebula surrounding a mag 10 star, round, about 2' diameter.  There is a striking curved irregular dark patch or globule along the west side of the central star that is remarkable at high power.  The nebulosity is weakest on the SE side of star.  Easily takes 220x-280x.17.5" (2/22/86): bright, round nebula around a 10th magnitude illuminating star.  A eye-catching, curved, irregular dark patch is NW of the central star within the nebulosity.13" (2/25/84): a curving dark lane is visible west of the central star with faint nebulosity west of the gap. 8" (11/28/81): small circular nebulosity surrounds a mag 10 star.************************************************************
