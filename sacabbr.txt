----Trumpler type for open clusters-----
Concentration
I.   Detached, strong concentration toward the center
II.  Detached, weak concentration toward the center
III. Detached, no concentration toward the center
IV.  Not well detached from surrounding star field

Range in brightness
1.  Small range        2.  Moderate range       3.  Large range

Richness
p  Poor (<50 stars)
m  Moderately rich (50-100 stars)
r  Rich (>100 stars)

An "n" following the Trumpler type denotes nebulosity in cluster

----Shapley-Sawyer concentration rating for globular clusters---

The values range from 1 to 12, smaller numbers are more
concentrated clusters.

----Vorontsov-Velyaminov type for planetary nebulae-----

1.  Stellar
2.  Smooth disk (a, brighter center; b, uniform brightness;
                 c, traces of ring structure)
3.  Irregular disk (a, very irregular brightness distribution;
                    b, traces of ring structure)
4.  Ring structure
5.  Irregular form similar to diffuse nebula
6.  Anomalous form, no regular structure

Some very complex forms may combine two types.

-----Hubble type for galaxies-----

E  elliptical, E0 is roundest to E7 is flattest
   subgroups; 'd'is dwarf, 'c'is supergiant, 'D' has diffuse halo
S  Spiral, 'a' has tightly wound arms, 'b' has moderately wound
   arms and 'c' has loosely wound arms
SB Spiral with central bar
Ir Irregular
