This data is marked "SAC" in the catalog entries.
Remarks and NGC descriptions also taken from SAC
database.

The RoadLingua shareware RoadLingua.prc is copyright (c) AbsoluteWord.
You can use it for free (especially from within AstroInfo, as there
is no nagging when RoadLingua is called from within a third-party
application), or you can purchase a full version at PalmGear.com.


NGCIC and SAC are RoadLingua dictionaries.

AstroInfo 3.10 (pre-release available on PalmGear) is capable of
looking up object information in these dictionaries.

There are two versions included: NGCIC and SAC, and RedNGCIC and RedSAC.
The latter have red text and are suitable for use with a red on black night-mode
display theme.

You can install just the catalog (either NGCIC or RedNGCIC or SAC or RedSAC
or some combination of these), or if you install NGCIC or RedNGCIC you can
additionally install the 37mb file of photographs of almost all the NGC
objects and some of the IC objects which can then be accessed from
RoadLingua.  Obviously the photograph file needs to be installed
on a memory card.

INSTALLATION INSTRUCTIONS
1. Install RoadLingua.prc dictionary viewer to your PDA's main memory.
2. Install the text catalog file(s) NGCIC.pdb and/or RedNGCIC.pdb and/or
   SAC.pdb and/or RedSAC.pdb either in main memory or on a
   memory card (\PALM\Launcher certainly works, and
   I think \PALM\RoadLingua will probably also work).  If you want to use the
   images, you should opt for a memory card, unless you have a ton of free
   memory.
3. Optionally, install the 37mb file NGCICPics.pdb in the same location
   as your NGCIC.pdb and/or RedNGCIC.pdb files to have photos of many of
   the objects.

Now, you can view the catalogs in RoadLingua.  You can tap on "photo" in the
NGC/IC catalogs to see a photo if the photos are installed.  

If you want to view the catalogs from within AstroInfo, then please ensure
you have RoadLinguaInterface.prc installed (included with the latest version
of AstroInfo) and whenever you have an object selected in the sky, catalog 
or observing list forms in AstroInfo, you can choose MENU | Sky | Dict. Object Lookup 
to try to lookup the object in RoadLingua.  You may need the latest beta 
version of AstroInfo 3.10.
