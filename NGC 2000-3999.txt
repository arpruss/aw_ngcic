NGC 2002 = ESO 086-SC003 = S-L 51705 30 21.0 -66 53 02V = 10.1;  Size 1.9x1.724" (4/7/08 - Magellan Observatory, Australia): at 200x this cluster is extremely bright but small.  It is sharply concentrated with a small, brilliant core surrounded by a much fainter 30" halo.  At 346x, the core diameter is ~15" diameter and 3 interior stars are resolved, the brightest on the SE side.  Sharing the same field 8' SE is the double cluster N2006 and S-L 538.  N2002 is at the west end of a huge star cloud (N2027) that extends nearly 40' to the east beyond N2041.************************************************************NGC 2003 = ESO 086-SC006 = S-L 52605 30 54.3 -66 27 59V = 11.3;  Size 2.113.1" (2/20/04 - Costa Rica): this compact cluster in the LMC appeared fairly faint, very small, round, 20" diameter.  Appears to have a star involved or increases to a sharp stellar nucleus.  The 3' star cloud Shapley-Lindsay 553 lies 9' ENE.************************************************************NGC 2006 = ESO 086-SC008 = S-L 53705 31 20.0 -66 58 23V = 11.5;  Size 1.6x1.424" (4/7/08 - Magellan Observatory, Australia): forms the southern member of a close pair of small clusters with SL-538 less than 1' N.  At 346x it appeared fairly bright, fairly small, ~30" diameter, brighter core, with no evident resolution.  Forms a small triangle with two stars on the east side.  Located 8' SE of N2002. Just 0.9' N is SL-538, a small, moderately bright glow that was sandwiched between a brighter star at the east edge and a fainter star off the west side.  At 346x the shape appeared irregular and ~25" diameter.  Interestingly, John Herschel's two positions for N2006 on different sweeps correspond closely with each cluster, so he apparently viewed both (quite similar in the eyepiece) and the pair should apply N2006.  Interestingly, Herschel didn't note this object as double, though, so he probably felt both were the central part of the "extremely rich assemblage of stars and clustering groups which fill the field."************************************************************NGC 2010 = ESO 056-SC139 = S-L 53105 30 34.6 -70 49 10V = 11.7;  Size 1.9x1.724" (4/5/08 - Magellan Observatory, Australia): this LMC cluster is located just 1.5' NE of 9th magnitude HD 37181.  This star is part of a large, scattered group of mag 8.5-10.5 stars including a prominent 24' loop with a double star (8.2/10.7 at 15") at the east end of the loop.  THis double star is 6' S of N2010.  N2031 lies 18' SE and the bright HII complex/cluster N2018 lies 15' S.************************************************************NGC 2012 = ESO 016-005 = PGC 1719405 22 35.4 -79 51 07V = 12.9;  Size 1.1x0.6;  Surf Br = 12.5;  PA = 117d24" (4/4/08 - Magellan Observatory, Australia): fairly faint, elongated 2:1 WNW-ESE, contains a very small brighter core.  A very faint star lies close following and a close double star lies 4' E.  An unequal brighter pair lies 5' NE.************************************************************NGC 201305 44 02 +55 47.6Size 418" (11/6/04): This unimpressive asterism consists of two small groups of stars to the NW of mag 8.9 HD 37880.  A group ~3' NW of the brighter star is a quartet containing two mag 10.5 stars, while 6' NW is a evenly distributed quintet of mag 11-12 stars.  Also, a couple of arcminutes further NW are 3 stars including a double.  The three small groupings are extended NW to SE and span 7', although John Herschel's description probably just applies to the first two groups which are 4' diameter.Discovered by John Herschel (h364) and described as "a poor cl of 8 or 10 stars 11 mag."  Reinmuth adds "10-12 st 11...14; BD+21d907 f 0.6'."  Described as "NOCL" by RNGC.  The NGC RA is 30 tsec larger than JH's discovery position and corresponds better with the center of the group.************************************************************NGC 2017 = h3780 = E554-**2205 39 16 -17 51.0V = 6.4/7.9/8.5/9.2/8.4/8.118" (3/13/04): multiple group of six stars mag 7-10 within 3.5'.  The stars are generally separated by at least 1' with the widest separation at 2'.  The brightest star is mag 6.4 HD 37643.  The brightest "star" to the SE is the C+D component, a close 8.5/9.2 pair separated by 1.4", making 7 stars in total.8": this is the multiple star h3780.  Six stars are visible including mag 7, 8, 8.5, 9 and 10 stars but this object does not appear to be a cluster.************************************************************NGC 2018 = ESO 056-SC141 = LMC N206A = S-L 53305 31 23.6 -71 04 11Size 25x1824" (4/5/08 - Magellan Observatory, Australia): this is a fascinating, showpiece HII complex with a cluster and a large, detailed nebula appearing like a fainter version of M8 -- of course, in another galaxy!  At 200x the cluster (S-L 533) is ~8' in diameter and includes a couple of dozen mag 11-15 stars.  The stars are involved in the glow of a bright HII complex that has an excellent response to a UHC filter.  Using the filter, the brightest region (N2018) is a very prominent 1' circular patch on the east end with fainter wings extending north and south, increasing the size to 3'x1'.  A wide pair of stars including a brighter star (HD 269676) is at the west edge of this patch.  Three additional elongated patches (each 1' to 1.5' in diameter) are strung out in a NW to SE line along the SW side of the complex (BSDL 2005, 2048 and 2120).  Another glowing patch of nebulosity, ~45" diameter, is to the west of of the brightest region and surrounds a couple of brighter stars.  Finally there is an isolated, elongated patch on the north end of the complex that seems detached (BSDL 2129).  Weaker sections of the nebulosity give the impression of dark lanes.  Surprisingly, Herschel's description applies only to the brightest region at the east end of this entire complex.************************************************************NGC 2022 = PK 196-10.1 = PN G196.6-10.905 42 06.2 +09 05 10V = 11.7;  Size 29"x28"18" (2/24/06): at 220x appeared moderately bright, fairly small, round, ~25" diameter, very slightly elongated, irregularly lit and brighter along the western half of the rim giving a "C" appearance.  A faint sparkle is occasionally visible on the WSW edge of the rim and images show this may be a faint superimposed star or knot in the planetary.  Excellent view at 320x.  The planetary is weakly annular with the rim a bit dimmer on the SE side.  At 435x, the shape is slightly elongated SW to NE, ~27"x22" with a mottled interior and a brighter rim, particularly along the western half.  The appearance is quite patchy at 565x and the sparkle on the SW end is still evident.  No central star seen at any power.17.5" (2/2/02): immediately picked up at 100x as a very small, bluish-gray "egg" of fairly high surface brightness.  Good contrast gain with OIII filter.  At 380x (unfiltered), it appeared as fairly bright, clearly elongated SSW-NNE, ~27"x20".  The surface brightness was irregular or mottled with a slightly brighter rim and darker center giving a weakly annular appearance.  The rim seems to have a couple of slightly brighter spots and the ends of the minor axis are slightly dimmer.  No sign of a central star.17.5" (12/8/90): fairly bright, slightly elongated 4:3 ~SSW-NNE, about 30" diameter.  Appears slightly annular at 412x with a brighter rim.  No central star seen at this power.13": moderately bright, high surface brightness.  No internal structure was visible.************************************************************NGC 2023 = LBN 954 = Ced 55o05 41 38.3 -02 15 33Size 10x1013.1": fairly prominent nebulosity surrounds mag 7.8 SAO 132464.

Consists of two main parallel sections elongated SSW-NNE separated by prominent detailed dark lanes.  Excellent structure with ragged edges, gaps, streaks, rifts and various brightness levels.  The eastern strip has one or two indentations or a scalloped inner edge.  The inner edge of the connecting strip has a sharply defined edge and the gap at the base connecting the brighter western section is obvious.  Zeta Orionis lies 15' NE detracts and the best view is unfiltered.8": fairly easy in very dark skies, the strip along the east side is longer with a possible gap at the base of "U" in the SW corner.  The center is definitely darker than the background sky.8" (10/4/80): fairly bright, large.  Consists of two parallel strips separated by a dark lane. Appears possibly broken (gap) at the base of "U".  Best view with a UHC filter.************************************************************NGC 2025 = ESO 056-SC149 = S-L 57105 32 33.1 -71 43 00V = 10.9;  Size 1.924" (4/5/08 - Magellan Observatory, Australia): at 200x this LMC cluster appeared bright, slightly elongated, moderately large, ~45"x40", weakly concentrated with a slightly brighter core. Three faint stars are resolved around the edges.  Two 8th magnitude stars lie 11' ESE and 13' ENE.************************************************************NGC 202605 43.1 +20 0817.5" (2/14/99): At 220x, ~30 stars in a 6' region including three mag 9-9.5 stars (mag 8.7 SAO 77440 and mag 9.3 SAO 77448).  Most of the stars are mag 11-13.  The group lacks any concentration and appears to be an asterism with the three brighter stars drawing attention to the group.  However, there is a small arc of a half a dozen mag 13 stars that includes SAO 77448 at the SE corner and a nice clump of mag 13 stars is just south of the mag 9.5 star at the north end of the group. Listed as nonexistent in the RNGC.Discovered by WH (VIII 28) and described as "a cluster of pretty large scattered stars. Not rich."  Reinmuth found "no distinct Cl" and followed by RNGC.************************************************************NGC 2027 = ESO 086-SC13 = S-L 59205 35 00.4 -66 54 5513.1" (2/20/04 - Costa Rica): huge star cloud, roughly elongated E-W, ~35'-40' in length (fills 105x field) by 20'.  At the E end is the bright cluster N2041, and a denser group of stars, N2034, while the cluster N2006n is at the NW end!************************************************************NGC 2029 = ESO 086-SC15 = LMC N63A = S-L 59505 35 40.8 -66 02 06Size 413.1" (2/20/04 - Costa Rica): fairly bright, fairly large, 3'x1.5', elongated N-S.  This LMC object appears to be a cluster with nebulosity.  A half-dozen stars mag 12-13 are resolved over an irregular background haze (unresolved stars?).  Located 32' N of mag 6.2 HD 37935.  N2003 lies 38' SW.  Embedded in the northern section is the compact SNR N63A (not noted).Jenni Kay notes that the GC/NGC positions for N2029 and N2030 are reversed from JH's original positions of h2911 and h2910, respectively.  In this case, N2030 is the NW portion of the Seagull Nebula and N2029 is this isolated nebula (all modern sources reverse the identifications).Jenni Kay notes that GC/NGC positions for N2029 and N2030 are reversed from JH's original positions of h2911 and h2910, respectively.  In this case, N2030 should be part of the Seagull Nebula and N2029 would be an isolated nebula. All modern catalogues reverse the historically correct identification.  See WSQJ #108, 4/97.************************************************************NGC 2030 = Seagull Nebula = LMC N59A05 35 00.5 -67 33 1824" (4/11/08 - Magellan Observatory, Australia): this is the NW component of the Seagull Nebula; a bright, highly structured 7'x5' emission nebula.  The brightest portion of N2030 is a bright streak elongated E-W that extends west from mag 12.3 HD 269810.  A large mass of nebulosity spreads to the north from this streak in a more circular 2' patch.  This object is incorrectly identified as N2029 in modern catalogues and atlases.************************************************************NGC 2031 = ESO 056-SC153 = S-L 57705 33 41.9 -70 59 16V = 10.8;  Size 3.424" (4/5/08 - Magellan Observatory, Australia): at 200x this LMC cluster was very bright, fairly large, slightly elongated NNW-SSE, well concentrated with a 1' core and 2' much fainter halo.  The cluster had a mottled texture but did not show definite resolution.  Located 12' NW of mag 7.6 HD 37899 and 5.5' SW of a mag 9.1 star.  A remarkable nebulous cluster, N2018, lies 12' WSW and N2051 is a similar distance to the ESE.************************************************************NGC 2032 = Seagull Nebula = LMC N59A05 35 20.6 -67 34 0624" (4/11/08 - Magellan Observatory, Australia): this is possibly the brightest section of the Seagull Nebula in the LMC (similar to N2035 1.6' SE).  It consists of a very bright, elongated ~SSW-NNE patch, 2'x1', with an unusual kidney-bean shape than is indented or concave on the east side.  N2032 is just separated to N2035 by an elongated SSW-NNE on the east side.  A faint, thin streamer of nebulosity shoots to the north from N2032.  Mag 11.4 HD 269808 is off the SW side.************************************************************NGC 2034 = ESO 086-SC1405 35 33 -66 54.213.1" (2/20/04 - Costa Rica): at 105x this is an interesting, elongated cluster NW of the compact cluster N2041 and located at the E end of a very large cloud of stars extending to the SW.  This condensed portion of the cloud contains a couple of dozen mag 12-13 star and a wide pair of mag 10 stars on the NW side.  The resolved stars are embedded in an unresolved glow of fainter stars, ~4'x2', extended E-W in a crescent shape, concave towards the north (arching N on the S side).************************************************************NGC 2035 = Seagull Nebula = LMC N59A05 35 33 -67 35.124" (4/11/08 - Magellan Observatory, Australia): this is the southeast section of the bright Seagull Nebula in the LMC.  At 200x using a UHC filter it appeared very bright, moderately large, with a very irregular shape similar to an anvil.  The very knotty, complex structure was elongated N-S, 1.6'x1.0', with the widest part of the anvil on the south end.  N2032, another very bright section, is very close preceding (roughly 1.6' between centers) and the two sections are separated by a dark lane oriented SSW-NNE.  A very faint streamer attached on the NE side flows to the north (N2032 has a similar but brighter streamer).  A fairly small detached patch, ~1.2' in diameter, is close SE (identified as LHA 120-N 59C in SIMBAD).************************************************************NGC 203905 44 01 +08 41.5Size 3018" (1/26/09): large, scattered field with a number of mag 8 to 10 stars, though too dispersed to resemble a cluster.  the most distinctive part is a nice 8' string of 6 collinear stars oriented E-W with mag 8 HD 38096 at the W end and mag 8.5 HD 38163 at the E end.  A larger elongated group of stars extends to the SE out to the edge of the 35' field.  This group probably contains unrelated field stars and there is no listing in SIMBAD.************************************************************NGC 2040 = ESO 56-EN164 = LMC N59B05 36 05 -67 34 0124" (4/11/08 - Magellan Observatory, Australia): this is a bright, irregularly round glow, ~2' diameter, located ~4' ENE of the Seagull Nebula and part of the same emission complex.  The nebulosity surrounds a cluster of roughly 15 stars.  Excellent contrast gain using a UHC filter at 200x which reveals a very irregular outline.  The DSS reveals delicate filaments to the south forming a large loop or shell (possibly a SNR shell) although this extension was not recorded.************************************************************NGC 2041 = ESO 086-SC16 = S-L 60505 36 28.0 -66 59 29V = 10.4;  Size 0.713.1" (2/20/04 - Costa Rica): at 105x, this LMC cluster appears bright, fairly small, round, 1' diameter, high surface brightness.  Symmetrical appearance and increases to a very small bright core and a stellar nucleus.  This young, massive cluster is located ~7' SE of the elongated cluster N2034 and at the E end of the very large, extended starfield N2027 (roughly E-W) which includes N2026 and N2002 on the western side.************************************************************NGC 2042 = ESO 056-SC163 = S-L 60105 36 09.6 -68 55 24Size 418" (7/8/02 - Magellan Observatory, Australia): fairly large, isolated patch of stars and haze, ~5' in size.  Includes roughly two dozen stars in an elongated group including a few mag 10 stars over unresolved haze.  Two additional knots of stars and haze are to the NW (not in the NGC or IC) and form an obtuse isosceles triangle with N2042.  The first knot is KMHK 1122, located 5' NW and S-L 585 at 10' NW.  N2042 is located just 17' NW of the center of the Tarantula Nebula.************************************************************NGC 2044 = ESO 056-SC165 = 30 Dor C05 36 06.2 -69 11 55Size 4.518" (7/8/02 - Magellan Observatory, Australia): group of about a dozen stars in a 3' diameter at 171x dominated by three brighter stars in a 1' E-W string.  Both the east and west "stars" in this line are actually compact clusters with multiple components on a HST image.  Situated in the outer portion of the 30 Doradus complex 16' from the central core.  Like N2060, this cluster also harbors a young SNR!  The site of SNR 1987A (05 35 28, -69 16.2) lies only 5.5' SW.************************************************************NGC 2046 = ESO 056-SC162 = S-L 59705 35 38.7 -70 14 23V = 12.6;  Size 1.324" (4/9/08 - Magellan Observatory, Australia): this is the first in a rich field of 8 NGC clusters (with the brightest N2058).  At 200x, it appeared bright, fairly small, slightly elongated WSW-ENE in the direction of a mag 13 star just 0.8' SW.  The core seems offset from the center to the NE end or a separate knot is attached at on the following end.  N2047 lies 3.2' NNE.  Located 6' SE of mag 8.2 HD 37762.************************************************************NGC 2047 = ESO 056-SC167 = S-L 60005 35 54.4 -70 11 29V = 13.224" (4/9/08 - Magellan Observatory, Australia): this LMC cluster is located on the west side of a rich field of 8 NGC clusters in the 13mm Ethos (200x).  It appeared moderately bright, fairly small, round, 45" diameter.  A faint star is at the south edge.  Forms a pair with slightly brighter N2046 3.2' SSW.

Embedded in the edge of an amazing linear stream of stars which runs through the field from SW to NE which begins just off the south side of the tendrils of the Tarantula Nebula and heads SW towards N2050!************************************************************NGC 2051 = ESO 056-SC169 = S-L 60805 36 07.5 -71 00 43Size 1.724" (4/5/08 - Magellan Observatory, Australia): at 200x this LMC cluster appeared bright, fairly small, round, 35" diameter.  Located 12' ESE of brighter N2031.  Two additional S-L clusters (617 and 624) share the field 8.5' SSE.  The cluster is also equidistant from a mag 9 star 8' NW and mag 7.6 HD 37899 a similar distance SW.************************************************************NGC 2057 = ESO 056-SC174 = S-L 61605 36 56.2 -70 16 10V = 12.2;  Size 1.824" (4/9/08 - Magellan Observatory, Australia): this LMC cluster is on the south side of a field filled with 8 NGC clusters.  At 260x it appeared bright, fairly small, round, ~30" diameter, fairly well concentrated with a small bright core.  Situated on a line between N2065 4' NE and a mag 10.4 HD 269839 3' SW.  N2046 lies 6.8' WNW, N2047 7.0' NW and N2058 6.4' N.************************************************************NGC 2058 = ESO 056-SC173 = S-L 61405 36 54.5 -70 09 44V = 11.9;  Size 2.124" (4/9/08 - Magellan Observatory, Australia): this is the brightest cluster in a 15' field of 8 NGC clusters including N2046, 47, 57, 59, 65, 66 and 72.  All 8 clusters easily fit in the field of 13mm Ethos at 200x and all fit in a 20' circle.  Using 260x, N2058 appeared very bright, large, well concentrated.  The outer halo extends up to 2' diameter using averted vision.  At 350x, a few very faint stars are resolved in the halo and around the edges of the core.  Two mag 12.5-13 stars lie 1' WSW and 1.5' WNW.  Other nearby clusters include N2059 2' N, N2066 4.1' E, N2047 5.4' WSW and N2065 5.8' SE.  Also I picked up a couple of "anonymous" clusters or HII knots, one is north of N2059 (OGLE-CL LMC 632) and the other following N2072 (LHA 120-N171B).  This group of clusters is located just over a degree south of the Tarantula Nebula.************************************************************NGC 2059 = ESO 056-SC175 = S-L 61305 37 01.5 -70 07 37V = 12.9;  Size 1.124" (4/9/08 - Magellan Observatory, Australia): this LMC cluster is on the north side of a field of 8 NGC clusters.  At 200x it appeared moderately bright, fairly small, round, 35" diameter.  At 350x it appeared grainy but was still unresolved except for a faint star at the north edge.  Located 2.1' NNE of N2058 and just 40" following a mag 12 star.************************************************************NGC 2060 = ESO 057-EN001 = 30 Dor B = SNR 0538-69.1 = LMC N157B05 37 46.9 -69 10 18Size 218" (7/8/02 - Magellan Observatory, Australia): this fairly small knot of nebulosity is situated just SW of the main mass of the Tarantula nebula approximately 7' from the center.  About a half-dozen mag 12-14 stars are involved with a total diameter of 2'.Studies have shown that this nebula contains a compact x-ray source and a rapidly rotating pulsar, indicating this object is a Crab-like supernova remnant in the LMC!  (see IAU Circ., 6810, 2 (1998)).************************************************************NGC 2061 = ESO 363-**1605 42 53.2 -33 57 29Size 1618" (1/15/07): at 115x I was initially attacted by a large, bright trapezoid-shaped asterism of 5 stars with a pair of 9.5-magnitude stars at 35" separation at the NW vertex.  The brightest star in the asterism is a mag 7.2 orange star at the NE vertex with an 11th magnitude companion (h3794).  But John Herschel was likely referring to an 8' scattering of a couple of dozen mag 13 and fainter stars that lie to the north of the bright star.  This group appears to be a random collection at the eyepiece.************************************************************NGC 206305 46 46 +08 45.518" (1/26/09): although nothing stands out in the field, near William Herschel's position is a group of 30 stars elongated N-S in a string.  Includes mag 10.1 HD 247555 near the N end, though the richest concentration is at the S end (7' S from the bright star).Other observers have picked brighter groupings in the area as N2063 and WH's description of  "a S Cl of vS sc st." is not very helpful.

With averted vision, the surface is mottled and the outer halo increases to at least 1.5'.  The cluster appeared very lively at 350x with a few stars just on the verge of resolution.  At this power the halo appeared up to 1.8' in diameter.  A mag 12 star is at the NE edge and two mag 13/13.5 stars lie ~1.5' WNW.  Eight NGC clusters reside in this one field with four other clusters within 6': N2057 4' SW, N2066 4.2' N, N2072 4' E and N2058 5.8' NW!************************************************************NGC 2066 = ESO 057-SC003 = S-L 62705 37 41.2 -70 09 58V = 13.1;  Size 1.024" (4/9/08 - Magellan Observatory, Australia): at 260x appeared moderately bright and large, round, 45" diameter, very weakly concentrated.

Sighting uncertain as only visible fleetingly.  [It's not clear from my description whether I observed the very low surface brightness circular patch NW of M78 or the brightest portion of the streamer pointing towards N2064].Discovered by Tempel (I).  According to Corwin, "NGC 2067 is a part of the large complex of nebulae around M78 = N2068. Found by Tempel, neither the position nor the description makes it really clear as to which part of the nebula he saw. The first position I give in the main table is for a large patch of pretty low surface brightness nebulosity about 5 arcmin northwest of M78. But this is not the brightest nebulosity in the area. That is a knot about 3 arcmin southwest, the brightest part of a long faint streamer pointed toward NGC 2064. This, however, is much more east than north of M78, while Tempel says that M78 is to the south.  So, a bit of a mystery here -- which part of the nebulosity was Tempel refering to? I've stuck with the larger more northerly end of the nebula, but could well be wrong, so have also put the southern knot in the main table."************************************************************NGC 2068 = M78 = Ced 55ug = vdB 5905 46 46.7 +00 04.7V = 8.0;  Size 8x617.5" (12/20/95): very bright reflection nebula surrounding two mag 10.5 stars with a mag 13 star involved at the S end.  Large, irregular shape, 6'x4'.  Brightest along the north side which has a sharply defined slightly bowed-out edge with one of the mag 10.5 stars near the midpoint.  A brighter knot is just following this star.  Irregularly fans out towards the south and fades with no distinct borders but tapers somewhat at the south edge.17.5" (2/1/92):very bright, surprisingly large, 6'x4'.  Surrounds two mag 10 stars although the nebulosity extends further to E of these stars.  Also a mag 13 star is embedded in the SE end.  Brighter and sharper edge gently curves from W to N side.  Appears to fan out to the SE where the nebula gradually fades into background.  Brightest in a group of reflection nebulae including N2064 7' SW and N2067 6' WNW.8" (12/6/80): bright reflection nebula, large, NW edge brighter and sharper, elongated, roughly rectangular, wide pair of mag 10 stars involved, striking.

See observing notes for N2070.************************************************************NGC 2070 = Tarantula Nebula = 30 Doradus = E057-EN6 = S-L 633 = LMC N157A05 38 38 -69 05.6V = 8.3;  Size 4024" (4/5/08 - Magellan Observatory, Australia):  The Tarantula nebula was simply unreal at 200x in the 13mm Ethos with a UHC filter -- better than any photo I've seen and convincingly 3-dimensional, even though I viewed it late so the elevation was only 20¡.  Although this magnification brought out an unbelievable amount of detail in the loops and ribbons, the main complex fit snugly in the eyepiece field (30').20" (7/8/02 - Magellan Observatory, Australia): the Tarantula is the largest known emission region (800-1000 light years) and is easily visible to the naked-eye from Australia.  The view of the Tarantula early in the morning through a 20" f/5 at 127x (20 Nagler) and OIII filter was jaw-dropping!  Near the center are several bright loops and arcs.  Extending out are a number of convoluted loops including one heart-shaped arch which is quite large.  Running out from the central region of the nebula are streaming lanes of nebulosity.  One in particular extends quite a long distance and the outer loops and streamers seem to merge into some of the nearby HII regions forming a mind-boggling complex.  There are perhaps 10 different loops and ribbons in the main body giving a 3-dimensional effect.  Near the center lies an extremely compact cluster of superluminous stars (R136) but only a few were visible including what appears to be a single bright star.  Also a number of additional stars are scattered about the main body.12" (6/29/02 - Bargo, Australia): first view of the Tarantula in Les Dalrymple's 12" was early in the evening, very low in the southern sky (20¡ elevation) and without a filter.  Even under these conditions it was a fascinating sight - fairly bright, detailed, 15' convoluted, mottled nebulosity with several striking loops or ribbons which radiate out from the central region.  Sweeping in the nearby fields I ran across numerous small knots of nebulosity and small clusters.************************************************************NGC 2071 = LBN 938 = Ced 55v = vdB 6005 47 07.2 +00 17 39Size 4x317.5" (12/20/95): fairly bright reflection nebula surounding a mag 9.5 star, 3.5' diameter.  Shape appears irregular (although no distinct borders) but extends more to the south side of the star which has a faint companion close south.  A second mag 9.5 star (not involved) lies 3.5' NW.  The field is strangely lacking in stars due to obscuration.17.5" (2/1/92): fairly bright reflection nebula surrounds a mag 10 star although extends farther S.  A second mag 13 star is embedded just S of the bright star.  The round outline gradually fades into the background.  A mag 10 star is 3.5' NW but the field is strangely devoid of stars due to obscuring dust.  Located 15' NNE of M78.8": faint reflection nebula.  Located 15' NNE of M78.

On the NE side a small, bright knot, ~35" diameter is superimposed on the general glow. At 216x at least 20 faint stars are resolved besides the two mag 10.5 stars.  This HII region is likely part of the same complex with N2081, a bright HII region that lies just 8' NE, and both of these are outlying sections of the Tarantula Nebula (24' N of N2074).************************************************************NGC 2076 = MCG -03-15-012 = PGC 1780405 46 47.1 -16 46 54V = 13.0;  Size 2.2x1.3;  Surf Br = 14.0;  PA = 45d17.5" (12/3/88): moderately bright, fairly large, oval SW-NE, fairly high surface brightness but no distinctive core.

At 200x and UHC filter it appeared bright, moderately large, elongated 2:1 E-W, ~1.2'x0.6'.  Without a filter, three fainter stars are involved in the glow.  Forms a close pair of bright knots with N2080 1.1' NE.  Another smaller pair of bright glows, N2085 and N2086, lies 3' and 4' ESE and finally a bright complex of glows including N2078, 2079, 2083 and 2084 lies 5' S.  Together these form a stunning field about 35' SSE of the Tarantula Nebula.  The listed dimensions refer to the entire nebulous field including extensions.************************************************************NGC 2078 = ESO 057-EN10 = LMC N159F05 39 39.7 -69 44 3724" (4/9/08 - Magellan Observatory, Australia): this is the northwest component of an impressive 4' emission nebula filled with bright knots with several of the brighter knots forming a curving "S" shape.  At 200x and UHC filter it appeared as a fairly bright, moderately large glow surrounding a mag 12 star and two fainter stars.  This knot is elongated ~E-W, ~1.2'x0.8' and is encased in a fainter outer halo that extends perhaps 1.5', mostly to the north.  An extremely bright isolated patch, N2079, lies 1.7' S and N2083 is a similar distance to the east.  Another very bright patch of nebulosity, N2077 and N2080, lies 6' N and a smaller bright pair, N2085 and N2086 is a similar distance to the NE.************************************************************NGC 2079 = ESO 057-EN11 = LMC N159A05 39 40 -69 46 2024" (4/9/08 - Magellan Observatory, Australia): this is the brightest section on the SW side of an impressive 4' collection of perhaps 8 different emission knots encased in a diffuse glow with 4 NGC designations. At 200x and UHC filter it appeared extremely bright, with a uniform very high surface brightness.  The outline has an unusual triangular shape (one vertex at the N end) with a well-defined border and ~1' in diameter.  Without a filter, a very faint star is located at the center of the glow.  N2079 is collinear with two mag 12 stars 1.7' N (at the center of N2078) and another mag 12 star 3.5' N. The main section of the complex to the NE forms a large "S" shaped group of multiple knots with N2078 1.7' N, N2084 to the east and N2083 to the NE.************************************************************NGC 2080 = ESO 057-EN12 = LMC N160A = S-L 641 = Ghost Head Nebula05 39 44.6 -69 38 45Size 1.7x1.524" (4/9/08 - Magellan Observatory, Australia): at 200x and UHC filter, this emission nebula (outlying section of the Tarantula located 35' NNW) is very impressive, appearing as an extremely bright nebulous glow with an irregular shape, ~1.5' diameter, slightly elongated.  The brightest section is encased in a larger, fainter nebulous glow that extends mostly to the south.  N2077, another bright glow, is attached on the SW, with center just 1' apart.  At 350x the view is fascinating with 3 or 4 stars involved (possibly one a knot) and the HII knot took on a curdled texture.  A couple of brighter stars are off the NW side and a number of stars trail off to the E and NE.  Roughly 6' S is another stunning group of nebulous glows consisting of N2078, 2079, 2083 and 2084.************************************************************NGC 2081 = ESO 057-SC13 = LMC N158A = LH 10405 40 00 -69 24.424" (4/10/08 - Magellan Observatory, Australia): At 214x, this is a gorgeous cluster of two dozen stars in a 5' region, including many mag 13-14.  Adding a UHC filter enhances a fairly bright HII glow nearly surrounds the entire cluster in a triangular wreath (weak in the center)!  The brightest portion is a ribbon with a bright glow at one end just south of the cluster extending due east (this knot is identified in SIMBAD as BSDL 2722).  With closer inspection this glow actually consists of a couple of knots and fainter streaks intersecting!  Just beyond the east end of this ribbon is N2091, a slightly elongated cluster that is collinear with the streamer.  N2074, a bright HII region and cluster (likely part of the same complex as N2081), lies 8' SW.************************************************************NGC 2083 = ESO 057-EN14 = LMC N159D05 39 58.5 -69 44 0824" (4/10/08 - Magellan Observatory, Australia): this is the NE section of the N2078/79/83/84 complex which shares the same field with two additional bright emission regions, N2085/86 4' N and N2077/80 ~5.5' NNW, creating a superb field of bright HII regions (outlying section of the Tarantula Nebula).  At 214x and UHC filter, it appeared as a bright, large, slightly elongated glow surrounding a mag 12.5 star, ~1.8' diameter.  A brighter knot is embedded within the glow on the west side (LMC N159I) on a line with N2078.  Removing the filter, the mag 12.5 star has a very faint companion and another brighter star is also embedded at the edge.  Although Herschel assigned 4 NGC numbers, I logged at least 7 brighter knots with Henize designations within this "S" shaped complex (see N2084 for more).************************************************************NGC 2084 = ESO 057-EN15 = LMC N159C05 40 07 -69 45 3024" (4/10/08 - Magellan Observatory, Australia): I returned to this detailed nebula the following night to make a complete observation at 200x using a UHC filter.  N2084 forms the SE region of the complex and it's composed of several nearby components.  At the NE end of this extended region is a moderately bright, round knot, ~45" diameter (N159G).  Without a filter a star is involved with this glow.  The second, brighter embedded "glow" is close WSW on a direct line with N2079.  This knot (N159C-east) corresponds with John Herschel's position for N2084 and appeared very bright, fairly large, elongated, ~1.2'x1.0'.  Removing the filter a couple of stars are involved (with one brighter star).  A fainter stream of nebulosity connects this glow with another glowing knot in essentially the center of the entire complex, 1.5' W of N2084 (N159C-west).  This third knot is fairly bright, moderately large, round, 45" diameter.24" (4/9/08 - Magellan Observatory, Australia): this is the SE component of a fascinating 4' HII complex filled with up to 8 distinguishable knots (4 have NGC numbers) with several of the brighter knots forming an "S" shape (this knot is at SE end of the "S").  At 200x and UHC filter it appeared very bright, round, fairly large glow, 1' diameter and encased within fainter nebulous haze that extends to the west.  N2083 lies 1.5' NNW within the background glow that envelopes the entire complex.************************************************************NGC 2085 = ESO 057-EN016 = LMC N160B05 40 09.3 -69 40 2324" (4/9/08 - Magellan Observatory, Australia): part of an amazing field of nebulous glows located ~35' SSE of the Tarantula Nebula and an outlying part of the same huge complex.  At 200x using a UHC filter the field is divided up into three main groups with N2085 and N2086 forming a close 1.2' E-W pair separated by a mag 10 star.  A larger, brighter region consisting of N2077 and 2078 lies ~2.5' NW and an impressive cluster of nebulous knots (N2078, 2079, 2083 and 84) is roughly 6' SSW.  With a UHC filter N2085 appears bright, fairly small, ~25" diameter. A mag 10 star is just off the NE end (23" from the center).  Forms a close pair with N2086 = IC 2145, a similar knot just 1.2' E.  Both of these knots are immersed in small, much fainter nebulous halos but the bright star itself does not appear to be involved.************************************************************NGC 2086 = ESO 057-EN018 = IC 2145 = LMC N160C05 40 23 -69 40 15Size 0.724" (4/9/08 - Magellan Observatory, Australia): this is the eastern component of a close pair of nebulous glows with N2085 just 1.2' W.  This pair is part of a fascinating group of numerous emission nebulae just 35' south of the Tarantula nebula.  At 200x with a UHC filter, this knot appears very bright (slightly brighter than N2085), fairly small, round, ~30" diameter.  Without a filter a faint star is near the center.  Located just 1' E of mag 10 HD 269953 which is nearly attached to N2085.************************************************************NGC 2089 = ESO 554-036 = MCG -03-15-016 = PGC 1786005 47 51.4 -17 36 08V = 11.9;  Size 1.9x1.1;  Surf Br = 12.6;  PA = 39d17.5" (12/3/88): fairly faint, fairly small, elongated 3:2 SW-NE, bright core, stellar nucleus.

A bright E-W ribbon is on the south side of N2081 with its vertex (brighter and larger end of the streamer) closest to N2074 (to the SW) and extending towards the east.  Just beyond the east end of this ribbon I picked up this extended glow that is collinear with the streamer.

Padova in Asagio No. 52), Helen Sawyer Hogg, 1959 (Star Clusters) and more recently in the RNGC due to its richness.

The brightest portion of the nebula is noticeably elongated N-S from the central star and 2'-3' in length tapering towards the star.  The northern extension has a slightly higher surface brightness. Located 3' W of a mag 9 star.  Observed at 220x without filtration.17.5" (12/23/92): faint, fairly small, elongated 5:2 N-S, ~2.5'x1.0', fairly high surface brightness.  A mag 11 star is at the S tip of the bright portion and a small very faint extension appears S of this star.  Located 3' W of mag 9 HD 41787.  Two mag 13 stars are 1' NE and 1' N and a mag 10 star is 5' S.  An evenly matched mag 10.5/10.5 double at 12" separation lies 8' WSW.  This reflection nebula doesn't respond to a Daystar 300 or OIII filter.  Listed as nonexistent in the RNGC due to an error in declination in the NGC.  Plotted as Ced 62 in U2000.Discovered by Stephan at the Marseilles Observatory.  In compiling the NGC, Dreyer accidentally used the declination of NGC 1741.  Dreyer later caught and corrected his error in the IC 2 Notes/Corrections section (Dreyer added the comment "my mistake"), but the correction was missed  by later cataloguers. As an example, in 1922 Edwin Hubble called it "A bright, uncatalogued nebula similar to NGC 2245" and Sven Cederblad listed his entry for #62 an "anonymous" object with no NGC or IC designation.  So, both were obviously thrown off by Dreyer's mistake.Skiff recomputed Stephan's original position using precise coordinates for his offset star HD 41787 as 06 04 53.62 +18 40 08.7 (1950).  At this exact location is the reflection nebula Cederblad 62 at 06 04 53.17 +18 39 55.0 just 0.45 tsec of RA and 13".7 in declination from Stephan's original coordinates!  Besides the excellent positional match, Stephan described NGC 2163 as "elongated with *11 attached south" and visually this nebula appears to extend more prominently north of the mag 11.5 (central) star.  On the POSS, Ced 62 is an interesting bipolar nebula with two symmetrical funnel-shaped jets extending north-south from the central star.More recently, Cederblad 62 wasn't referenced as a NGC object in the first edition of the Uranometria 2000.0, Sky Atlas 2000.0 or the Sky Catalogue 2000.  The RNGC lists this object as nonexistent and furthermore reverses the sign of the declination.  In addition, a poor RA  was given for Ced 62 in Sky Catalogue 2000 and it was misplotted on the U2000 too far E (position corrected In U2000 V2).************************************************************NGC 2164 = ESO 057-SC062 = S-L 80805 58 56.0 -68 30 57V = 10.3;  Size 2.524" (4/11/08 - Magellan Observatory, Australia): this is the brightest of four clusters in a 10' field.  At 260x it appeared very bright, large, round, sharply concentrated with an extremely bright core (appears to be a globular), the large outer halo extends to 2' diameter.  Roughly 15 stars are resolved in the halo - some of these are easily resolved 14th mag stars, while others are quite faint.  At 350x, up to two dozen stars are resolved and the core is very grainy.

Fairly small, about 6' diameter, not rich.  The stars are divided into two main subgroups - along the west side is a string of six stars aligned N-S in a very shallow "V" asterism.  The northern two stars in this string form the wide double ·844 = 8.8/9.9 at 24" and less than 2' S is mag 8.7 SAO 95271.  The eastern subgroup consists of 9 stars forming a distinctive triangle outline and includes the close double star ·848 = 7.5/8.0 at 2.5".  The brighter stars form a fairly distinctive "37" pattern!  Located 0.9 degrees WSW of Xi Orionis.************************************************************NGC 2170 = LBN 994 = vdB 67 = Ced 63 = RAFGL 87706 07 31.8 -06 23 57Size 2x218" (1/13/07): fairly bright, moderately large reflection nebula surrounding a mag 9.5 star, ~2.5' diameter.  There are two stars bracketing the nebula at the north and south ends with the brighter southern star 10th magnitude.  Reflection nebula vdB 69 lies 8.5' ENE.13.1" (1/28/84): fairly bright nebulosity surrounds mag 9.5 SAO 132861.  Also a star 8' ENE is slightly nebulous (vdB 69).

At 350x, the glow is clumpy with 4 stars resolved with the brightest star (possibly a field star) at the SE edge.  Located 10' SE of N2164 and 11' ESE of N2159.

A wide pair of 12th magnitude stars lies 2.4' ENE and 3.5' ESE.  N2199 (galaxy), lies 38' SE, and another LMC cluster, N2209, lies 68' SE.************************************************************NGC 2174 = Ced 67a = LBN 854 = Sh 2-252 = Monkey Head Nebula06 09 23.6 +20 39 34Size 40x3017.5" (1/16/02): at 64x and OIII filter, this is a beautiful, detailed nebulosity surrounding a mag 8 star (SAO 78049), extending at least 20' diameter.  The OIII filter gives a dramatic contrast gain.  With averted vision and careful viewing, the outer borders extend to ~25'.  Structure includes interior streaky dark lanes visible to the west of the star.  The rim is slightly brighter or has a higher contrast on the western edge but slightly more nebulosity is visible on the following side of the star.Without a filter at 64x, I was surprised to immediately notice a moderately bright 3' round glow, situated ~11' NNW of SAO 78049 near the NW edge of the main glow.  Interestingly, this patch of nebulosity is more prominent than the main body without a filter and is probably the section of the HII complex visually discovered by Stephan!  It seemed quite strange that this patch had such a different filter response and dimmed significantly with the OIII (mainly reflection component?).  A curving arc of stars is situated along the north side of the glow.  The entire nebula is situated among a scattered group of stars, which is often mistaken for N2175.  Located 1.4 degrees ENE of Chi(2) Orionis.17.5" (2/28/87): very large, irregular nebulosity surrounding mag 8.0 SAO 78049.  Dark lanes are evident west of the star, appears very streaky.  A bright small unresolved knot is 3.2' ENE of the bright star using an OIII filter [this is N2175]. 13" (1/18/85): very bright with filter, very large, surrounds a mag 8 star, sky very dark off W side.  West of the star the nebula is mottled and streaky with a bright region near the N edge.N2174 was discovered by Stephan (Object #7, List IX, Comptes Rendus, vol 87, p. 869).  His description does not describe the entire nebulosity or a scattered cluster but rather a small patch of nebulosity (without the accents): "excessive., excess., faible (a peine observable); a l'interieur d'un triangle forme par trois petites etoiles".He gives a 1878 position of 06 02 07.47, +20 40 54.4 which precesses to 06 09 24.0 +20 39 53 (2000), and falls on the NW side of the nebula.  This probably needs a small correction in declination based on his reference star, but is still accurate enough to clearly identify a small brighter patch of nebulosity.  His three stars are mag 13-14 in GSC and the knot of nebulosity is quite prominent on DSS just following the middle of these three stars.  This star has a GSC position of 06 09 21.9 +20 39 30 (2000) and Stephan's knot appears only 30"-40" in diameter.************************************************************NGC 2175 = Ced 67a = LBN 854 = Sh 2-252E = Cr 84 = Monkey Head Nebula06 09 39.5 +20 29 15Size 40x3017.5": See description for N2174.  Although the scattered group of stars involved with the HII region is identified as N2175,  the NGC description (from Auwers and Bruhns) does not refer to a cluster but rather a "*8m in neb (Auw No 21)".  The position given is 10' south of N2174 and 16 tsec east.  But in the IC 2 notes and correction, Dreyer gives a correction in RA from Bigourdan to 06 01 32.  This places N2175 at 06 09 52 +20 29.1 (2000) and is just 1' south of the brightest section of the nebula (about 3' ENE of mag 8 SAO 78049).************************************************************NGC 2179 = ESO 555-038 = MCG -04-15-011 = PGC 1845306 08 02.2 -21 44 48V = 12.3;  Size 1.7x1.2;  Surf Br = 12.9;  PA = 170d13.1" (1/28/84): fairly faint, fairly small, almost round, broad concentration.

A scattering of brighter stars in the vicinity increase the apparent diameter to perhaps 20'x15', though besides the half-dozen or so brighter stars this appears to be an asterism.  A half-dozen mag 8.5-10 stars 10' to 12' E and N from the mag 7.1 star roughly define an eastern border to the group.

At 220x and 280x this double star was cleanly resolved [10" separation] although the region between the pair and the bright star (just 30" from the southern star) appeared slightly hazy, probably due to two additional very close faint stars just below resolvability. At 410x, at least one very faint sparkle was occasionally glimpsed close to the mag 10 star.  It is not difficult to see why Lohse may have suspected this object to be nebulous.  Coincidentally, a very faint reflection nebula (GN 06.11.5) is located 6.7' NNW and it is identified as N2195 in RNGC.Lohse's position is 17 tsec W of a double star (with two additional very faint stars in a chain).  His description of a mag 10 star 30" north, pins down this identification.  Interestingly, on my first observation of this object, I also thought it was nebulous - either due to glare from the mag 10 star or the closeness of the chain of the stars.  Coincidentally, there is a very faint (reflection) nebula 6.7' NNE in the same field which was also visible in my 17.5" and this object has the same RA as Lohse's original position.  The RNGC has incorrectly picked this object as N2195.  See NGCBUGS and e-mail discussion on sci.astro.amateur 12/97.Wolfgang Steinicke has this to say about Lohse: The discoverer was Gerhard Lohse, a German working at Scarborough using a 15,5 inch refractor. The object is one of 18 nebulae (from a total of 20) Dreyer put into the NGC. Lohse is among the observers with the poorest statistics:  Only 3 objects are real nebulae (the galaxies NGC 2518, 2565, 6792)! 12 are stars (or asterisms), 3 are "not found".  From the existing, NGC 2518 is the faintest, but an easy object with V around 13 mag a and compact core (in NPM1G).  Due to this, it is questionable, if he really saw GM1-45. The description of a 10 mag star 31" N matches the small group. In general Lohse's positions are not bad, there are "objects" at the places, but in most cases no nebulae.************************************************************NGC 2196 = ESO 556-004 = MCG -04-15-014 = UGCA 121 = PGC 1860206 12 09.5 -21 48 27V = 11.0;  Size 2.8x2.2;  Surf Br = 12.8;  PA = 45d13.1" (1/28/84): fairly bright, fairly small, almost round, increases to a small bright core.************************************************************NGC 2199 = ESO 034-003 = PGC 1837906 04 45.0 -73 24 00V = 12.8;  Size 1.9x0.8;  Surf Br = 13.1;  PA = 37d24" (4/4/08 - Magellan Observatory, Australia): moderately bright and large, elongated 2:1 SW-NE, 1.2'x0.6', small bright core, occasional sharp stellar nucleus.

This object was recently discovered to be a planetary in 1985 (Shaw and Bidelman) and is listed in the CGCG.Swift discovered this nebula in 1887 (list VI).  It is listed in RNGC and CGCG (204-005) as a galaxy although the RNGC new description reads "R, HISB, STEL, PLN??".  In 1985, spectroscopic investigations by Richard Shaw and William Bidelman revealed that N2242 is indeed a previously uncatalogued planetary nebula (also independent discovery by Machara (A&A 178, 221).  Listed as a new planetary nebula in Kohoutek's 4th update list (AN 315, 1994). So, the RNGC type should to be changed to 4 (planetary).

Viewed unfiltered at 225x.17.5" (3/8/02): small but high surface brightness reflection nebula surrounding an unequal pair of mag 9.5/12.5 stars at 7" separation.  At 280x, the nebulosity is round and approximately 50" in size although it fades smoothly into the background and may be a bit larger.  This small knot of nebulosity is at the western end of a striking arc of 6 stars which trail off to the NE.  The next star in the arc, 1.5' E, also seems to be encased in a very small halo.  A similar mag 9.5 comparison star (with no halo) lies 4' ESE and several other mag 9.5-10.5 stars are scattered across the field.  The background sky in this vicinity is weakly luminous, as N2327 is situated midway along the western side of IC 2177, a huge IC strip of nebulosity straddling Canis Major and Monoceros.  This object did not respond to OIII, UHC or H-beta filters so appears to be predominantly a reflection nebula.This bright nebula was discovered by William Herschel (IV 25) in 1785 and reobserved by his son, John.  Although their positions and descriptions match this object  there is a great deal of confusion in the literature as to its identification and position and some sources misidentify N2327 with the much larger Sh 2-292 = Gum 1 located 50' to the north (also associated with IC 2177).13" (12/22/84): fairly faint reflection nebula, fairly small, surrounds a mag 8 star (close unequal double).  Located along the faint, extremely large, curving strip of nebulosity = IC 2177.Discovered by WH (IV 25) in 1785.  John Herschel described "a double star whose large star is in the center of a very faint nebula which involves the small star also." His position of 07 04 07.6 -11 19.0 pins down the identification as a compact HII/Reflection nebula on the W side of the Seagull Nebula. In 1886, Engelhardt also published an accurate micrometric position of  07 04 07.77 -11 18 56.6 (J2000).  Howe also noted the central star is double with separation 7".Despite JH and Englehardt's accurate positions and Herschel's good description, there has been a great deal of confusion in the literature as to the identification and position.

A mag 15 star is 1' NE.  Located 2' SW of N2332.  Identifications reversed with N2332 in the RNGC and identified as IC 457 in the CGCG/RC3.In the three Lord Rosse observations of the N2332/N2340 field a total of 9 objects were found and sketched.  For some reason the only additional object that Dreyer decided to include in the NGC was N2330.  Swift and Kobold later surveyed the field and Dreyer included accurate positions for all of Rosse's objects shown on the sketches in the IC.Since Rosse did not provide positions, Dreyer probably had to rely on Rosse's sketch which incorrectly placed N2330 north of N2332 instead of southwest and Bigourdan's positions that unfortunately referred to single stars.  N2330 is incorrectly placed 2.4' N of the larger and brighter N2332.  N2330 was then properly sketched at a later observation and recatalogued by Dreyer as IC 457. Therefore, it is fairly certain that N2330 is identical to IC 457.  The 1950 positions for these galaxies are:N2330 = IC 457 = M+08-13-078 = CGCG 234-074     07 05 37.9 +50 13 59  N2332 = U03699 = M+08-13-079 = CGCG 234-075   07 05 43.7 +50 15 46 The identifications and positions given in the RNGC are(R)N2330  07 05.7 +50 16  E, R, BM, DKLNSUSP(R)N2332  07 05.7 +50 15  E, R, BM, ALMSTELBased on the RNGC declinations it is clear the RNGC has reversed the identifications of N2330 and N2332 making N2330 the brighter northern member of the pair and incorrectly describing N2332 as "almstel" (same error in MCG).  So, the data for N2330 and N2332 should be reversed in the RNGC. This galaxy is identified as IC 457 in UGC and CGCG.  See RNGC Corrections #5.

In any case, JH definitely observed N2332 = h430 and Dreyer used his correct position in the NGC, so the ID is certain.

Located 4' S of mag 7.3 SAO 14129.  A mag 10 star lies 5.2' NE.  Forms a wide pair with IC 2179 = UGC 3750 13' N.Discovered by WH (III 746).  His original discovery position (with respect to his reference star) is 07 16 44 +65 00.7 (2000).  In GC, JH modified his father's position to 07 16 19 +64 48.2 (2000) although he did not reobserve this gx. This latter position is 16 tsec E and 6' N  (or 9' NE) of U03759 = M+11-09-039.Bigourdan later observed this field in 1894 and 1900. His original position for B267 = IC 2179 in Comptes Rendus is 07 15 33 +64 57 (2000) which is an excellent match for U03750 = M+11-09-038a at GSC position 07 15 32.2 +64 55 34 (2000).  CGCG, UGC, MOL, DSFG, RC3, PGC and U2000 all identify this galaxy as IC 2179.  His listing in the complete Observations, etc. for B267 gives a position of 07 16 06.2 +64 43 01 (2000), which matches U03759, the galaxy identified as N2347 in modern catalogues and his listing for N2347 matches U03750 (Corwin notes an error in his identification of the reference star).So, apparently Bigourdan has reversed the identifications here.  Based on his original position it is possible that WH's original observation refers to U03750 instead (as Bigourdan claimed).

Richest around mag 6 SAO 152598 on the S side where 50 stars are in a 8' rectangular outline.  A bright double star ·1052 = 9.1/9.3 at 20" is located just 2' NE of the mag 6 star and two mag 9 stars are at the NW and NE corners of this subgroup.

Very rich in a 2.5' central "core" with the brightest mag 10 star just SE of this core.  The outline is marked by rows of stars giving a triangular outline.  Mag 8 HD 56329 lies 7' NE of the cluster.13.1" (1/18/85): about 50 stars down to mag 14 in a 8'x5' group elongated N-S including a mag 10 star at the SE edge.

Corwin equates N2356 = N2355 (see description for N2355).  Also about 20' W of Herschel's position are 15 stars in a 3' arrowhead outline.  This asterism is well detached in the field and though not impressive is also a possible candidate.  A nice equilateral triangle of mag 11.5-12.5 stars with sides of 1' form the eastern corner of the group.Discovered by WH (VII 6): "A pretty rich and compressed cluster of stars."  Observed once at Birr Castle: "A dozen st scattered loosely over the field."  Reinmuth adds "no Cl n of NGC 2355, in 7h 8m.0 +14d 13' (1860) a loose clustering of st 11... in triangle." There is no obvious clustering on the GSC to the N of N2355 but at Reinmuth's position (about 1 tmin preceding the NGC position) is a triangular group which stands out well!  Listed as nonexistent in RNGC. As the NGC position for N2356 is just 12' N of N2355 it seems plausible that WH accidently recorded the same object twice.************************************************************NGC 2357 = UGC 03782 = MCG +04-17-014 = CGCG 116-046 = FGC 619 = PGC 2059207 17 40.9 +23 21 23V = 13.3;  Size 3.5x0.5;  Surf Br = 13.7;  PA = 122d17.5" (1/19/91): faint, large, edge-on 6:1 NW-SE.

The central region is a 5' bubble (illuminated by a Wolf-Rayet star) with a brighter rim along the west side giving a "C" appearance with irregular knots, filamentary wisps of nebulosity and areas of thinner nebulosity in the interior.  A number of fainter stars are superimposed in the central region along with some brighter mag 11 stars on the north portion of the rim.  Attached at the south end is a brighter 4' extension elongated towards the west with a  mag 9 star at its SE side.  This section then thins out into a long 10' streamer which precedes the main section and forms the southern "horn" of the helmet.  A second long, thicker streamer is attached at the north end of the central mass and extends out to the NW (this piece has been misidentified as IC 468). A fainter strip of nebulosity also begins on the north end and extends 10' due east while weak nebulosity is also east of the central helmet off the south side.  Illuminated by the Wolf-Rayet star HD 56925 = WR 7.13" (1/28/84): unusual emission nebula, fairly bright, fairly large, about 7'x5'.

Tau was easily resolved into a triple with two mag 10 and 11.2 companions at 8" and 14" to the east.  At 170x, 75-80 stars are visible and the cluster appears fully resolved.  A string of stars passes to the north of Tau oriented NW to SE.  Several faint stars and a detached clump lie to the north of Tau beyond the string.  A mag 8.5 star marks the south border of the cluster.13.1" (2/18/04 - Costa Rica): stunning open cluster at 105x surrounding Tau Canis Majoris which is a very close triple star.  Perhaps 75 stars are resolved in a well-detached 6' region.17.5" (3/2/02): at 100x, this is a gorgeous, uniformly rich cluster surrounding Tau CMa, which is offset north of center. A WNW-ESE string of stars north of Tau gives a flattened border and the rich southern portion tapers to the south giving a triangular appearance.  At 220x, ~60 stars are visible in a 6' diameter, many of 10.5-11.  Just following the central star to the ESE are two mag 11 companions.  Several other fainter stars are in the central core including one fairly close preceding.17.5" (2/28/87): about 75 stars in 6' diameter surrounding Tau Canis Majoris (V = 4.4) in an unusually rich, impressive cluster!

The eastern group of stars hooks on the SE end, bending back towards the north.  Both groups have strings of faint stars extending to the north beyond a mag 9.5 star located ~5' N of the main groups.  Listed as a nonexistent cluster in the RNGC, although the group is fairly distinctive.Discovered by JH (h442): "Two S p close groups of pL st in the milky way, rather a remarkable cl."

At 323x this knot is irregular in shape (~20"x15", SW-NE) and brightness and at moments resolves into two or three components.  The galaxy itself is fairly faint, large, and very elongated SSW-NNE, 3.5'x1.0', with a low surface brightness.13.1" (1/11/86): fairly faint, very large, elongated 5:2 SW-NE, low almost even surface brightness.  An unusually bright HII region is at the SW end of the galaxy (2' from the center) and appears as a "fuzzy" 12th magnitude star.  Although very small it seems elongated SW-NE and similar to a poorly resolved double star.  Definite contrast gain with OIII filter.Discovered by WH (III 748).  This NGC dec is about 11' too far S.  WH's description "vF, vS, has a vF branch nf" actually describes the HII region at the SW end with the main body of the galaxy as Herschel's "vf branch nf."  Copeland's description at Birr Castle clearly places the surrounding objects (stars and nebulous objects) with respect to the HII region!

A wide brighter double star (ARA 962 =10.9/11.5 at 18") oriented N-S lies NE of center and two faint companions are also near. 8" (1/1/84): almost three dozen faint stars, triangular-shape, rich field.************************************************************NGC 2422 = M47 = NGC 2478 = Cr 15207 36 35 -14 29.0V = 4.4;  Size 3018" (3/2/08): this naked-eye cluster is stunning at 73x (31 Nagler), though at 30' diameter is too spread out for higher powers.  The stars are arranged in beautiful chains and groups.  The brightest half-dozen stars are in 10' subgroup in the center including a striking white double star (7.0/7.3 at 7") that is is surrounded by many stars in chains and loops.

Most eye-catching is a small trapezoidal group with a double star at the NW vertex and a wide pair at the SE vertex.  A string of 3 stars oriented SW-NE is within the trapezoid.  Off the SE vertex an oval chain of stars extends south and west before looping back towards the trapezoid.  There are no dense regions and this appears to be an asterism.

The cluster appears slightly elongated E-W although there are no clear borders. There is no increase in concentration towards the center and except for two brighter stars on the W side the cluster is unusually uniform in brightness (mag 11-13) and distribution in the main body.  There is a noticeable 2' void, though, very close to the center of the cluster.  Around the periphery the distribution becomes quite scraggly and the cluster mixes with the general field density.

The annulus is quite prominent and relatively thick with a weakly glowing interior.  The rim is irregularly lit and a bit weaker on the NW side and brighter along the eastern edge.  A mag 12.8 star is just NW of the center of the annulus (this is not the central star, though) and a fainter interior star (mag 14?) on the SW side (half-way to the rim) was also visible.  A mag 11 star is just off the SE edge.  At 807x, the rim is noticeably brighter and thicker on the eastern half compared to a weaker section along the NW side and an extremely faint star intermittently pops out on the NNE side on inner edge of the annulus (confirmed on 3/4/08 at Lake Sonoma).17.5" (3/2/02): at 280x this is a beautiful, 1' diameter PN with a darker central hole at 280x situated on the NE side of the rich oc M46.  A mag 13 star (not the central star) is within the central hole slightly offset NW of center.  The rim is fairly uniform but slightly brighter along the NE side.  The 20" central hole is clearly darker although there is not a dramatic contrast.  A brighter mag 11 star is just off the SE edge (about 15"-20" SW of the mag 11 star a faint mag 14-15 star was also intermittently visible) and a string of faint stars oriented WNW-ESE is just over 1' S.

The compact high su rface brightness inner region is elongated NNW-SSE.  Two bright knots comprise both ends and the surface brightness is irregular.  The nebulosity is much weaker SW of the main body with a cup-shaped dark "notch" protruding into this central bar.  The outer halo is oriented SW-NE with a brighter wing similar to a spiral arm attached at the west edge which swings back towards the south.  The outer nebulosity is weaker and less well-defined on the N and NE sides.13"  (2/23/85): very bright and small with a very high surface brightness.  This planetary has a double shell structure with an elongated box-shape oriented NW-SE and a fainter shell oriented SW-NE.  One or two condensations are visible in the central part.

The main bar of the galaxy is fairly bright and extended ~2:1 in a SW to NE orientation with a length of ~3'.  The bar has just a weak, broad concentration with no real core but it rises sharply at the center to a very small, brighter nucleus.  The main arm is attached at the NE end of the bar and extends a short distance in that direction before dramatically bending sharply to the west (turning nearly 150¡) and extending ~3.5' in length towards a mag 12.9 star.  At the NW end this well-defined arm fades and broadens a little, terminating just SE of the 13th magnitude star.  At the SW end of the bar, a thick arm emerges extending to the SW where it more gently curves around towards the east while fanning out.  This arm is not as sharply defined as the inside (east) portion of the curve blends with a diffuse glow extending from the bar.  The total distance between the tips of the arms spans nearly 5'.  In the same field, 10' ENE, lies ESO 59-11 and N2534 is 16' NNW.  The field also includes a number of mag 9 to 11 stars that frame the galaxy.20" f/5 (7/8/02 - Magellan Observatory, Australia): at 127x (20mm Nagler), the main body of this unusual galaxy appeared as a fairly faint, large, thick "bar" with just a weak concentration except for an extremely small bright core. On the NE end of the bar, a faint "arm" emerged at a sharp angle towards the NW.  The contrast was improved at 212x and the brighter arm was easier to view, extending at nearly a right angle to the main body and curving towards the west on the N side.  On the SW end, a broad, short, low surface brightness extension was visible bending towards the SE.  The main bar was elongated 2:1 SW-NE, roughly 3'x1.5', but the thick outer arm significantly increased the size to ~4.5'x2'.************************************************************NGC 2443 = NGC 2442 = "Meat-hook Galaxy" = E059-008 = PGC 2137307 36 23.9 -69 31 4824" (4/4/08 - Magellan Observatory, Australia): This number refers to the prominent arm attached at the NE end of the bar.

The main section is roughly mushroom shaped, extending generally south of the bright star.  The southern border is locally brighter along a strip oriented NW to SE.  There is a sharp light cut-off (apparently due to dust) passing to the north of the central star and oriented E-W.  Faint haze extends 15' to 20' to the east towards a 12'-15' string of brighter stars that are oriented NW to SE.  The nebulosity brightens and broadens into a 12' stream roughly parallel to this group of brighter stars (catalogued as Haffner 18).  Removing the filter this is a gorgeous low power Milky Way field with numerous faint stars superimposed in the region of the nebula.17.5" (3/2/02): Using a 31 Nagler at 64x and an OIII filter, this is a prominent 7' nebulosity surrounding a mag 8 star.  A dark lane appears to cut through the nebula from west to east starting NW of the central star.  Fainter nebulosity extends beyond the dark lane but then fades out to the north.  The south and southeast border of the main mass has a bright, distinct edge and the southern border has a small extension on the west edge which hooks towards the NW.A finger of nebulosity extends from the main body towards the NW and involves a scattered group of brighter stars (this is Haffner 18). This strip dims but nearly merges with a much larger, elongated mass of fairly faint nebulosity extending NW to SE at a roughly right angle.  This section is ~15' in size with an irregular border that is bounded on the NE side by a string of brighter stars.  This is a fascinating HII complex to explore in a rich star field!17.5" (1/23/88): at 82x with OIII filter appears as a large, bright, circular nebulosity about 10' diameter.  A mag 7.8 star is involved north of center and several fainter stars are involved.  The nebulosity is brightest along the south side in a strip oriented NW-SE.  A group of brighter stars is NE (Haffner 18).  A separate larger (~15') but fainter section is 10'-15' NE and appears elongated.  8" (3/24/84): fairly bright, moderately large, roughly circular.

The field is beautifully rich, at least 45' diameter though there was no distinct border.  The star field looks impressive beyond the edges of the 66' field of the 20 Nagler.  On the NW side is a rich, elongated strip of ~20 stars that is quite eye-catching.  Includes a few pairs and a neat triple with a fairly close unequal mag pair at the SSW end of the elongated strip.13.1" (2/18/04 - Costa Rica): this cluster is a very bright, scattered field of stars that completely fills the nearly 40' field at 105x.  Partially resolved in the 9x50 finder.  At the NW edge is a rich elongated strip of two dozen stars including a couple of close, unequal pairs and tight fainter triple.  John Herschel's description applies to this denser group of stars. A mag 6.4 star (h4051 = HD 68450) with two mag 13.5 companions is off the NW side of the larger group but does not appear to be part of the cluster and a similar star lies to the SE (HD 68862).13.1" (1/18/85): ~75 stars, bright, very large, scattered, overfills 30' field.  8" (3/28/81): ~25 stars, rich, elongated.

There is a very distinctive, gently curving arc of stars bowed out to the east that defines the eastern side of the central region and the brightest mag 6.5 star is along this arc.  Three nice pairs are to the W and NW of the mag 6.5 star (one of these pairs has a third fainter companion forming a triple).  The main portion of the cluster is enclosed in two outer strings of stars that form a large "V" with the vertex to the east of the mag 6.5 star and the pair of strings increase the diameter to 30'.  While scanning for NGC 2547 I ran across a bright, distinctive red star to the west (probably M3-class HD 67821).13.1" (2/18/04 - Costa Rica): this is a very bright naked-eye cluster that includes a number of mag 7-8 stars.  It appears at least 20'-25' in diameter, though the outer boundaries are pretty arbitrary.  Very unusual arrangement as a number of the brighter stars form a curving arc which is bowed out towards the east and which defines the eastern border of the cluster!  The brightest mag 6.5 star is within this arc on the south side of the cluster.  The cluster is encased in faint reflection nebulosity, though this was not visible.************************************************************NGC 2548 = M48 = Cr 17908 13 43 -05 45.0V = 5.8;  Size 5413.1" (2/16/85): about 125 stars in a large 40' field with no distinct borders.

The only possible candidate near his position is a mag 11.7 star 2' S of his position and a group of five mag 13.5-14.5 stars close south of the brighter star.  Four of the stars are strung along a 5' gently curving arc.  To the NE is a much brighter 10' string of a half dozen stars that extends towards the NE.  Neither of these asterisms, though, are probably eye-catching enough to even be described by Herschel as a "course cluster".  Listed as nonexistent in the RNGC.  Corwin suggests as another possible candidate a group of about a dozen stars surrounding SAO 42564 at 08 49 47.4 +44 42 15 (J2000), though this is over two degrees south of Herschel's position. So, this object is still lost.************************************************************NGC 2667 = MCG +03-23-007 = CGCG 090-016 = Ho 98a = IC 2410 = PGC 2474108 48 27.3 +19 01 09V = 13.9;  Size 0.8x0.3;  Surf Br = 12.2;  PA = 80d17.5" (1/28/89): very faint, small, elongated E-W.

Herschel's Ray is brightest along a 5' stretch at the NNE end as it passes to the west of mag 8.3 HD 774433 and continues NNE ending to the west of a mag 9.5 star.  Several very faint stars appear to very close to the northern half of the ray, particularly along the eastern edge, though a mag 11.2 star is also at the western edge.  The ray weakens or thins to a narrow splinter just the east of this mag 11.2 star.  At the NNE tip the filament subtly bends very slightly towards the N and at the SSW end the filament more obviously curves or hooks slightly towards the south as it fades.13.1" (2/18/04 - Costa Rica): Herschel's Ray was easily picked up at 105x using a UHC filter.  It extended well over 1/2 of the 38' field, at least 20'x2', oriented SSW-NNE.  This prominent Vela Supernova filament is brightest towards the NNE end near a mag 8.3 star which is just following the NNE edge.  It appears like a thin splinter of light through the field with a weak filamentary structure and variations in brightness, similar to one of the fainter filaments in the Veil nebula.  Several stars are very close to the edge including a mag 11 star near the middle.  I was impressed the appearance was very comparable to the view I had through the 18-inch in Australia.18" (7/7/02 - Magellan Observatory, Australia): this is an isolated bright eastern filament in the Vela Supernova remnant which is centered over 4¡ to the west.  At 128x and UHC filter (38 arcmin field), it appears as a fairly faint, thin, nebulous streak extending SSW-NNE over half the field, roughly 20'x1'!  The surface brightness is roughly uniform, though the northern portion is brighter near a mag 8.3 star off the NE end.  The nebulosity continues past this star and ends with a mag 9.5 star due east of the NNE tip.  On the SSW end the nebulosity gradually dims out.  A few mag 11 stars border the filament, one just off the west edge near the center and a couple further south.On 1 March 1835 JH discovered this object at the Cape of Good Hope and described it as "eeF, L, vvmE; an extraordinary long narrow ray of excessively feeble light; position 19 deg±.  At least 20' long, extending much beyond the limits of the field...".  This agrees perfectly with the ESO-Uppsala listing NGC 2736 = ESO 260-N14, a nebula with dimensions 30'x7', position angle of 20¡ and note "Luminous filament".  Corwin adds that on the ESO IIIa-F film this nebula is the brightest patch of a huge supernova remnant whose delicate wisps cover the field (centered roughly 5 degrees WNW).  A relatively bright star is immersed in N2736 (mentioned by JH).RNGC and NGC 2000.0 misclassified this object as a galaxy and I mentioned this error in RNGC Corrections #5.  The first reported connection of NGC 2736 with the Vela SNR was in 2000: http://www.journals.uchicago.edu/ApJ/journal/issues/ApJL/v543n2/005648/005648.html, two years after the discovery of the SNR itself in 1998.  Estimated age of the supernova is 9-11,000 years.************************************************************NGC 2737 = UGC 04751 = MCG +04-22-005 = CGCG 121-009 = PGC 2545309 03 59.7 +21 54 23V = 14.1;  Size 0.9x0.4;  Surf Br = 12.8;  PA = 61d17.5" (1/28/89): fairly faint, fairly small, very elongated WSW-ENE, small bright core.

At 225x it appeared clearly as a faint star.  Located 2.4' W of N2809 and a similar distance NNW of N2807.  N2806 is incorrectly identified as MCG +03-24-030 in RNGC, MCG and PGC.Dreyer's description from 22 March 1876 reads:  "A vF * or cS, eF neb p [N2809] (sky bad), forming an equilateral triangle with [2807] and [2809] (susp as neb by d'A, = [N2806])."  At this position there is a mag 14.5 star with a GSC position 09 16 56.7  +20 04 14 (2000).  This star forms an equilateral triangle with N2807 and N2809 as stated by Dreyer and lies due west of N2809.  Since his descriptions and offsets for other objects in the field are exact, there is no mistaking the identity of N2806 as a single star.N2806 was not found by Bigourdan.  Reinmuth apparently describes this star as "eS, R, ? neb *13.8, IC 2455 np 2.8', N2809 f 2.6', B double star spp 2.2'."  RNGC, MCG (M+03-24-030), DSFG and U2000 misidentify N2806 with an extremely faint companion of N2807 situated just preceding the south edge.  This galaxy was highly suspected in my 17.5" although apparently it was not seen by Dreyer! (he did note the sky was bad).  This galaxy (MCG +03-24-030 = NPM1G +20.0205) should not receive a NGC designation.

The central region displays an unusually strong concentration with a super-intense 2' core that was unresolved.  A very bright, small halo surrounds the core that is mottled but mostly unresolved.  The outer halo resolves into perhaps 150-200 stars mag 14.5 and fainter.  The halo gradually thins out in resolved stars out to 10' diameter. The core was still unresolved at 350x.

At 144x, this cluster is mottled but with no obvious resolution.  At 166x a large number of extremely faint stars (mag 14-15) pop in and out of view over the entire disc, though the resolved stars could not be held steadily.

The halo is noticeably elongated, nearly 3:2.  A dense swarm of mag 14 and fainter stars are resolved in the halo and around the edges of the core but the inner central core is unresolved.  At 228x, there appear to be some very faint stars lanes streaming into the halo which are just unresolved but look like small tentacles.  A mag 10/10.6 double at 16" is outside the cluster ~10' ESE.  This is by far the brightest concentration class I globular and the only one easily resolved.

The RNGC incorrectly equates N2957 with N2963 so both are plotted as one object on the U2000.Discovered by JH (h617).  His RA is exactly 1 tmin W of M+12-10-001+2 = Z332-064 but his description of a "*13m near" matches a similar star off the SW edge.  This galaxy is located 3' WNW of brighter N2963 which was discovered by his father William and reobserved by John on the same night he discovered N2957.  John's offset from N2963 of 32 tsec in RA pins down the identification N2957 = M+12-10-001+2 = Z332-064.  Looking over the RNGC data, it is clear that the entry for N2957 is simply a duplicate of N2963.  In my observation of N2957 I did not resolve the two components.

The spiral structure is unusual with a very long, relatively thick arm that curves from west to east on the north side of the core.  This arm then bends south on the west side and contains a very faint 20" HII knot which is NW of the core and symmetrically placed opposite a star in the outer halo on the SW side.  A fainter star is near the end of this arm, due west of the core.  To the east of the end of this arm the light level noticeably dips (this is a gap between the arms) on the south side of the galaxy giving an asymmetric appearance.A second fainter outer arm running roughly SW to NE also wraps around the galaxy on the north side but at further distance from the core.  This outer arm nearly reaches a star on the SW side of the galaxy (the one opposite the knot mentioned above) and then can be followed with more difficulty to the east where it connects on the south side of the core.13.1" (1/18/85): fairly bright, very large, elongated 3:2 ~E-W, 4.5'x3.0', sharply concentrated with a bright core, no nucleus.

It is a distant spiral no more than 1' across with a brighter core, faintly visible through 20 cm in good conditions.  The magnitude is about 12.5 and little more seems to be known about it.  John Herschel discovered it on the same night as NGC 3195, and he noted a 15th magnitude star within, but off centre.Andrew James: NGC 3149 is a galaxy that lies near the same field of NGC 3195. It can see in the same field if the planetary is placed at the bottom SE edge of the eyepiece, with the galaxy being near the edge in the NW. At magnitude 13.1 it is clearly visible in a 20cm., subtending a circular size some 2'x1.9' min.arc.

Two mag 14 stars are close S (nearest is 2.0' from the center) and a mag 11 star is just off the NNE edge 3.5' from the center.************************************************************NGC 3199 = ESO 127-EN014 = Gum 28 = RCW 4810 17.1 -57 55Size 22x2224" (4/11/08 - Magellan Observatory, Australia): at 200x and UHC filter this Wolf-Rayet bubble appeared as an amazing 180¡ crescent, open on the east side and forming a thick "C" shape.  The rim of the bubble is widest on the western portion, although it is slightly brighter on the SW side.  The main portion of the crescent spans ~13' from the N to S end and ~3.5' thick in the middle, though fainter nebulosity spreads out to the SE. Embedded near the S end is a double star ( h4302 = 10.4/11.6 at 23").  The surface brightness is fairly high overall, though irregular with slightly brighter patches, knots and streaks.  Along the outer western edge a faint 5' linear streak or filament is superimposed running SSW-NNE, though it separates or resolves from the Crescent at its N and S ends.  The illuminating mag 10.6 Wolf-Rayet star (WR 18 = HD 89358) is located about 4' E of the center of the "C".  This W-R bubble is situated four degrees NW of the Eta Carina nebula in a rich Milky Way star field.13.1" (2/17/04 - Costa Rica): at 105x and UHC filter, this HII region appears as a remarkable, huge crescent, roughly 11'x7' (the main region extends nearly 1/3 of the 39' field).  Opens up towards the east in a huge "C" shape.  The SW portion of the crescent is brightest, although the overall surface brightness is irregular with a mottled or curdled appearance.  A few stars are superimposed even with the filter with the brightest stars at the SW end.  Fainter nebulosity sprouts out of the SW end, increasing the total size by several arcminutes.  Surprisingly, N3199 was visible in the 9x50 finder by blinking with the OIII filter as an elongated bar of nebulosity!18" (7/8/02 - Magellan Observatory, Australia): this is an amazing HII region with a 20mm Nagler and UHC filter at 103x.  It appears as a fairly bright, thick crescent opening towards the east, roughly 10'x6'!  The surface brightness was quite irregular with a UHC filter and the nebulosity was noticeably brighter on the south end where a couple of brighter stars are embedded.  Off the bright portion of the south end, much lower surface brightness haze extends the curve further SE for several arcmin and spreads out somewhat increasing the length to  ~15'.  The main mass has a curdled, mottled appearance and dark lanes appear to intrude into the nebulosity.  The illuminating star HD 89358 is a Wolf-Rayet star (WR 18) and this nebulosity is reminiscent of the Crescent Nebula in Cygnus (it could be dubbed the "Southern Crescent").************************************************************NGC 3200 = ESO 567-045 = MCG -03-26-037 = UGCA 210 = PGC 3010810 18 36.5 -17 58 57V = 12.0;  Size 4.2x1.3;  Surf Br = 13.7;  PA = 169d17.5" (1/31/87): moderately bright, very elongated 3:1 NNW-SSE, moderately large.

An unusual feature is the large number of brighter cluster stars that appear to be superimposed right on top of a fainter layer of stars in the central core.  The core seems displaced displaced towards the north side as if part of the northern half of the cluster was obscured and flattened.  This apparent affect may also be due to a larger number of brighter resolved stars superimposed on the northern half of the core.  A number of stars in the outer halo are in strings and chains and the outline is irregular.18" (7/8/02 - Magellan Observatory, Australia): beautifully resolved globular at 171x and 228x.  The cluster is fairly large, ~8'-10' diameter with more careful viewing.  Roughly 150 stars are resolved, though the number grows with magnification and averted vision.  A fairly dense layer of brighter mag 11.5-12 stars are resolved right over the bright core.  The halo, which has a large number of mag 13 stars, has a scraggly, irregular edge and seems elongated - possibly partially obscured by dust.  This concentration class X cluster is 7th in ranking of brightest stars and 10th in horizontal-branch mag stars (high resolution).13" (2/23/85): this fairly bright globular cluster appears fairly large and mottled.

Not found by Lord Rosse in six observations and not found by Reinmuth or Carlson (repeated in RNGC).  As his description is "pB" this probably is a duplicate observation with a bad position although h mentions it could be a comet in GC.  In the NGC notes, Dreyer states that N3234 is probably identical to N3235 with a 1 degree error in declination.  In the IC 1 notes, though, Dreyer states that ­ N3235 as both seen by Denning.

This member of AGC 1060 (Hydra I) has a disputed identification due to a poor discovery position.Discovered by E.P. Austin (Annals of Harvard Observatory, Vol 13, #207) within the galaxy cluster Abell 1060 and placed at 10 34 55 -27 30 (1950).  No galaxy exists at this position within the cluster although RNGC identifies N3315 as E501-047, located at 10 34.9 -27 13 (1950).While this identication is possible, Austin described a "star 1' NW" which does not apply to this galaxy.  There is a very bright 5th magnitude star 3' N which would have warranted special mention as it would have interfered with the observation.  However, 30' N of Austin's position is ESO 501-G48 = MCG -04-25-042 at 10 37 19.2 -27 11 30 (2000) which has a 10th magnitude star 1' NW.  Based on Austin's visual description and a probable digit error in declination, this identification appears more likely and is the one used in ESO-Uppsala and RC3.  Corwin originally listed this number as a duplicate of N3314 (which Austin observed the same night) but now feels it was more likely a 30' error in dec by Austin.  (R)N3315 = E501-047 is located 17' S of the galaxy listed here.************************************************************NGC 3316 = ESO 501-054 = MCG -04-25-046 = LGG 211-006 = PGC 3157110 37 37.3 -27 35 39V = 12.6;  Size 1.3x1.1;  Surf Br = 12.818" (4/9/05): faint, small, round, 30" diameter, increases to a small, brighter core.

The second of 3 in a triangle."  Peters claimed an observation but this object was not recovered by Rosse, Schultz, Bigourdan or Reinmuth.  Just 1' W of Peter's position is a mag 15.1 star at 10 46 57.5 +13 47 31 (J2000) and 1' S is a mag 14 star at 10 47 01.3 +13 46 29 (possibly elongated on the DSS image?).  Carlson identifed N3771 with a star based on Mount Wilson photographs.  But, in NGCBUGS, Corwin argues that the trio Herschel is referring to is N3379, N3384 (h751 = N3371) and N3389 (h753 = N3373), as this trio matches the position angles given in the observation of the first of the group.

This is easily the largest bright emission nebula in the sky and a very prominent naked-eye object within the amazingly rich Carina Milky Way.  Bright islands of billowing nebulosity are separated by dark lanes or rifts and the entire complex overfilled the 105x field at the eyepiece.The surface brightness of the various sections is fairly uniform and pretty high, though it lowers in the outskirts.  No section is comparable in intensity to the central heart of the Orion Nebula, but the large wedge that contains Eta Car is quite prominent.  A UHC filter enhances the nebulosity without significantly dimming the stars.  Just west of Eta (within the central wedge) is the fairly prominent, dark "Keyhole Nebula" that extends ~5' length and elongated N-S (not as contrasty as when John Herschel named it in the 1830's).  Eta Carina's orange color and the small bipolar blowouts are quite stunning at high power.  Involved with the nebulosity are several clusters, the most prominent being Tr 16 just south of Eta Car.20" (7/8/02 - Magellan Observatory, Australia): Using a 20 Nagler (127x) and UHC filter, the field of Eta Carina was a breathtaking sight.  The outer wings and streamers extended well outside the 39' field.  The turbulent nebulosity had a curdled, electric appearance with a strong 3-dimensional effect as brighter streaks, wings, fainter masses and dark lanes were mixed together throughout the field.12" (6/29/02 - Bargo, Australia): My first views of the Eta Carina nebula through Les' 12.5" and Gary's 20" were truly breathtaking and dwarfed the Orion Nebula in size and detail.  The nebula is broken into 4 or 5 main separate masses of varying sizes, shapes and surface brightness by three wide, dark obscuring dust lanes.  The mottled nebulosity has an amazing 3-dimensional curdled appearance and is riddled with dark bays and rifts.  Outer loops and brighter streaks complete an amazing vista. The brightest section forms a triangular wedge isolated by prominent dark lane which cuts at a striking right angle.  This wedge contains the centerpiece Eta Carina which has an amazing orange color.  Extending from Eta are the two small lobes (one is brighter), referred to as the "Homunculus nebula" and appearing as an explosive event from the early 19th century in a HST image.  Just preceding Eta is an elongated N-S, curving dark lane nicknamed the "Keyhole Nebula" by John Herschel as well as the open cluster Tr 16 just south of Eta.The best overall view of the nebula was in the 20" at 80x (32 mm) using a UHC filter.  Even at this low power, the Eta Carina nebula still overfilled the field with contrasty dark lanes and amazingly structured islands of nebulosity.  I stared into the eyepiece quietly, somewhat stunned by its beauty.  With this aperture at 282x, the 12"x8" bipolar Homunculus nebula was an astounding sight.  The orange central star appeared quasi-stellar with the unequal blowouts fairly prominent.  They had an eerie, translucent appearance with the western lobe somewhat smaller, fainter and more pinched with the eastern lobe more circular.  A possible dark lane is near the center and punctures the lobes.  See involved clusters Tr 14, Tr 16.************************************************************NGC 3373 = N3389: = U05914 = MCG +02-28-013 = CGCG 066-022 = PGC 3230610 48 28.0 +12 31 59See observing notes for N3389.Discovered by JH (h753) and described as "F, R, the last of 3 in a triangle."

This is a double system [29" between centers] which was not resolved or only one component visible.  Member of AGC 1177.Discovered by Swift (I). His position is 1.0 tmin E of CGCG 125-032 but similar in declination.  His relative separation from N3555 is 10 tsec in RA and 0.5' S but if N3555 = U06203 then the actual separation is 3.2 tsec and 1' S.  Corwin suggests that N3551 may instead be the brightest member of Abell 1177 (although described as fainter than N3555) and then N3555 = CGCG 125-034. This galaxy  is mentioned in the notes of U06203 as 0.2x0.2 + 0.2x0.15 but it is not identified as N3551 in UGC or CGCG and not found in RC3, MCG or DSFG. The two galaxies are given separate positions in GSC at 11 09 41.2 +21 44 25 and 11 09 42.8 +21 44 07.  RNGC (and PGC) identifies the western component as N3551.

Listed as nonexistent in the RNGC.Ormond Stone recorded a very faint pair of nebulae which he gave the same rough position 11 08± -19 46 (1950) in list I.  Dreyer included these two objects as N3565 and N3566.  ESO-Uppsala and RC3 both identify N3565 = N3566 = E570-IG008, an interacting double galaxy located at 11 05 19.7 -19 45 05.3 (1950), essentially two tmin W of Stone's position (typical error in the first discovery list).  On the POSS, the images of these two small galaxies are merged and difficult to individually distinguish.  So, it's possible that Stone observed this galaxy and a nearby faint star for his second object.As Sulentic could not find any galaxy at Stone's original position on the POSS, he classified N3565 and N3566 as nonexistent in the RNGC.  Assuming N3565 = N3566 = E570-IG8 with a two minute error in RA, the RNGC position for these objects should be changed to 11 06.6 -19 53 (1975).  Listed as a single entry in ESGC and in ESO, RC3, ESGC and PGC.  As an alternative, Corwin suggests that N3565 and 3566 may apply to IC 2623 and a star close S, though this requires a 4 tmin error in RA  See RNGC Corrections #6 and NGCBUGS.************************************************************NGC 3566 = N3565: = E570-IG008 = NPM1G -19.0363 = PGC 3370111 07 47.8 -20 01 20V = 14.3;  Size 0.7x0.5;  Surf Br = 12.9;  PA = 126dSee observation of NGC 3565.Discovered by Stone along with N3565 (see notes) in list I.

The nebulosity is generally elongated E-W, ~5'x3', but with bays and extensions and dark lanes.  The surface brightness is highest to the south of the embedded cluster with a dark lane slashing through the nebulosity just west of the bright core.  At 350x, 15-20 stars were resolved in the glow, though the tiny, brilliant "core" cluster was only mottled and barely resolved into a few stars.13.1" (2/20/04 - Costa Rica): at 105x a bright irregular nebula surrounds a mag 9 "star".  At 200x, a half-dozen very faint stars are packed very close to the central star.  This very compact knot is actually a distant, very dense, young cluster of extremely luminous stars!  Adding a UHC filter, the nebulosity is irregular at 105x, extending mostly south of the star and fading out into two or three sections that are possibly divided by a dark lane.  The brightest section is to the southwest of the central star.18" (7/7/02 - Magellan Observatory, Australia): at 228x this distant but superluminous HII region is a fascinating clump of stars of and nebulosity surrounding a bright 9th magnitude knot.  The bright central region was extremely dense and contained 10-12 stars crammed into 2', yet it seemed only partially resolved at the very center into a couple of stars.  At 128x and UHC filter, the surrounding "haze" is clearly gaseous in nature with the brightest portion offset to the SW side from the core with a roughly broad fan with a total size of approximately 5'x3'.  A dark lane appears to cut through the nebulosity towards the core and there is a strong impression that the field is riddled with dust lanes and patches.  This is a well-studied highly reddened, luminous cluster (~20,000 light years) and HII region with similarities to the Tarantula nebula in the LMC!************************************************************NGC 3604 = NGC 3611 = U06305 = MCG +01-29-026 = CGCG 039-103 = PGC 3447811 17 30.1 +04 33 19See observing notes for N3611.Discovered by WH (II 626).

The relative position for the latter two exactly match N3695 = GC 5564 = U6490 and N3700 = GC 5566 = U6494.But on 18 Mar 1876 Dreyer reobserved N3694 and stated "nnp is a pS, eeF neb [=5564] in PA 357.2¡, Dist 256.7"."  This was the position Dreyer used in NGC for N3695, although it corresponds with mag 14.8 GSC star at 11 28 53.1 +35 29 00 (2000).  In the same observation, Dreyer notes "about 15' n and a few minutes f is another eF, vS neb [5565] with an ef* 2' sf."  Apparently he felt this object was not observed on 31 Mar 1867 so it was given a separate designation, GC 5565 = N3698, but this rough description appears to describe U6490 = N3695 which has a mag 14.4 GSC star 1.7' SE.  So, it seems likely that N3698 is a duplicate observation of N3695.

The planetary is bisected by a prominent, broad dark rift that slashes through the planetary from WSW to ENE (like Centaurus A!).  The northern lobe is the more prominent: both larger and brighter.  The shape of this lobe is semicircular with a round, outer periphery but with a fairly straight edge SW-NE in the interior due to the dark rift.  The center of the dust lane is south of the geometric center of the planetary, giving an asymmetric distribution to the lobes.  The rift itself is widest at the ENE end and tapers down towards the WSW end.  Superb view at 350x as the extra magnification increases the contrast and confirms that the south lobe is fully detached by the dust land at the WSW end.  The compact planetary He 2-67 lies in the same field 11' SE.13.1" (2/17/04 - Costa Rica): at 100x, this planetary appeared moderately bright and large, ~60"-65" in size.

A dark rift running WSW-ENE appears to nearly detach the smaller and fainter southern section.18" (7/7/02 - Magellan Observatory, Australia): at 128x this interesting planetary is moderately bright, fairly large, ~70" in diameter with some faint stars superimposed.  With the UHC filter the appearance is very unusual with a dark rift bisecting it in a WSW-ENE orientation just below the geometric center.  At 228x, the northern "hemisphere" is both larger and brighter with an irregular surface brightness.  A mag 13 star is ~1' NW.  This is a fascinating planetary set in a beautiful Centaurus star field with an appearance similar to faint HII region or a small version of Cen A!************************************************************NGC 3700 = UGC 06494 = MCG +06-25-079 = CGCG 185-073 = PGC 3541311 29 38.6 +35 30 53V = 14.0;  Size 1.0x0.7;  Surf Br = 13.6;  PA = 130d17.5" (4/18/98): faint, fairly small, elongated 3:2 ~N-S, 1.0'x0.7', weak concentration.

Leavenworth describes two mag 10 stars 30 tsec W and 30 tsec E.  There is a mag 9-10 star 20 tsec ENE and a mag 13 GSC star 20 tsec W so this identification is very uncertain.

Picked up 2.6' E of N3704.  Incorrectly listed as nonexistent in the RNGC.N3704 and N3707 are attributed to both Common and Tempel in the NGC.  Common's description in Copernicus, Vol 1 reads "2, F, R, on the parallel, star symmetrically placed between."  Howe could only find 1 object on 4 nights.13' due S of Common's single position (obtained from the setting circles) is a very faint pair of galaxies observed in my 17.5".  The first of these galaxies is N3704 = M-02-29-037 at 11 30 04.6 -11 32 48 (2000) which has a mag 15 star 42" E.  N3704 also has an extremely faint and compact companion 1.7' E with the mag 15 star between the galaxies as in Common's description, so it is a reasonable match for N3707 at 11 30 11.6 -11 32 37.  For some reason, the RNGC ignores the second fainter galaxy of the pair and lists N3707 as nonexistent.Unfortunately, the NGC summary descriptions (from Tempel?) have some errors.  The listing for N3704 mentions a mag 9-10 2' SSE of N3704, although the bright star is actually 2.6' WNW.   Additionally, the description for N3707 mentions a "*15 (neb?) 2s following", which actually describes the mag 15 star 2.8 tsec following N3704.  Nevertheless, Common's description is sufficient to identify this pair of galaxies.

Leavenworth's position is 0.6 tmin E and 6' N of N3724 (in a group with N3722, all with uncertain identifications), although N3724 is described as a pair only with N3722.

The DSFG data appears to apply to this galaxy although the given position is closer to M-1-30-008.Another possibility is that N3730 refers to one of the extremely faint galaxies in a trio which is NE of M-01-03-003.  Of this trio, the galaxy at 11 34 43.3 -09 31 59 is the brightest and is located 15 tsec E and 7.6' N of M-01-30-007 which is a good match with his delta Dec from N3724.

His position is 1.7 tmin W of M-01-30-018 although the declination matches. The RNGC RA is incorrectly given as 0.7 tmin farther west than the position given here.  Leavenworth mentions a *10 is 15 tsec preceding.  There is no bright star west but instead mag 13.5 GSC star 16 tsec W and Leavenworth's magnitudes are often listed much too bright.

Both eF, vS.") they seem unlikely to be duplicate observations although both numbers were equated by Dreyer in his 1912 NGC Correction list (repeated by Reinmuth).In Scientific Papers of WH, Dreyer notes that N3852 was not found by Bigourdan but that possibly there was a 1 tmin error in RA in reducing the position which happened on a number of objects observed in the same sweep!  Corwin suggests N3848 and N3852 may be duplicate observations of N3822 and N3825 which have the same declination and 3.2' separation but lie 2.0 tmin W of H's position.  So, I have N3852 = N3825 listed here, although this identification is not certain.************************************************************NGC 3853 = UGC 06712 = MCG +03-30-081 = CGCG 097-107 = PGC 3653511 44 28.3 +16 33 29V = 12.4;  Size 1.7x1.0;  Surf Br = 13.0;  PA = 140d17.5" (3/29/89): fairly faint, fairly small, elongated NW-SE, halo increases to a small bright core.************************************************************NGC 3854 = N3865 = MCG -01-30-02811 44 52.1 -09 13 58See observing notes for N3865.Discovered by Leavenworth (List II, #449).

The identifications are very uncertain in this group.N3855 and N3856 were discovered by d'Arrest.  The declination is listed as uncertain in the NGC although Dreyer gave a more accurate position (from Spitaler) for N3855 at 11h 41.6m +33d 37' (1950) and N3856 at 11h 41.8 +33d 37' in the Notes and Corrections section of the IC 1.  At this exact position on the POSS is a pair of galaxies that were later reentered into the IC 2 as IC 2952 and IC 2953 (accurately placed by Javelle) with the following object (IC 2953) both larger and brighter.UGC, MCG and CGCG identify these two galaxies with the IC designations since the IC identifications are certain and RNGC, MCG and CGCG identify N3855 = M+06-26-028 = CGCG 186-036, a very small galaxy located 5' SE of the close pair, while N3856 is listed as nonexistent in the RNGC. It seems very unlikely that this was the single galaxy seen by d'Arrest as IC 2953 (15.1z) in the same field is both larger and more prominent visually than M+06-26-028 (15.6z) based on my 17.5" observation.If we accept Spitaler's corrected positions in the IC 2 notes, then N3855 = IC 2952 and N3856 = IC 2953 and the RNGC, MCG and CGCG have misidentified both numbers with M+06-26-028 = CGCG 186-036.  It is also possible that N3855 = IC 2953 and N3856 = M+06-26-028. Thomson favors these identifications and they are given here.  See RNGC Corrections #5.Corwin feels since d'Arrest only gave a rough position for N3855 and just mentions the second galaxy in the description (offset) it is more likely that he picked up the brightest two galaxies in the vicinity - IC 2953 and N3847 about 9' to the north.  So, he proposes N3855 = IC 2953 and N3856 = N3847!************************************************************NGC 3856 = MCG +06-26-028 = CGCG 186-036 = PGC 3656911 44 44.9 +33 19 16Size 0.5x0.517.5" (4/14/01): extremely faint, small, round.

This galaxy has a very low surface brightness on DSS!From Mike Kerr: This is a fairly bright galaxy which is situated "in" the bright Centaurus Milky Way, near in the sky to the open cluster NGC 3960 and the bright Planetary Nebula NGC 3918.  NGC 3882 is only 5.3 degrees from the Galactic plane. Most of the other galaxies in this area of sky are B magnitude >= 15,  possibly due to much higher foreground extinction.  The Schlegel et al (1998) extinction maps give extinction of AB = 1.671 and E(B-V) = 0.387 (that is, 1.284 magn. of visual extinction.). NGC 3882 has a recently measured aperture photometry magnitude from LEDA, which is B magnitude 12.80 +/- 0.10.From Andrew Jones: NGC 3882 (11462-5624) is the SB spiral galaxy, west by 1.8 degrees, and perhaps a little south of NGC 3960. This galaxy is just visible in a 30cm, but is difficult without averted vision. Measured at photographic magnitude 13.3, this galaxy appears slightly elongated, along PA 65¡-245¡. In apparent size it is stated as 2.3'x1.3' - close to the size seen in the telescope. In a 30cm. I could not discern any structure, although there is a hint of brighter core and some detail in the southern portions of the galaxy. (I have not seen this structure myself). The visual poorness of this galaxy is understandable as it is immersed within the Milky Way.************************************************************NGC 3883 = UGC 06754 = MCG +04-28-053 = CGCG 127-054 = NPM1G +20.0286 = PGC 3674011 46 47.1 +20 40 31V = 12.6;  Size 3.0x2.4;  Surf Br = 14.617.5" (2/20/88): faint, fairly small, very slightly elongated, weak concentration.

Located 3.7' NE of N3888.N3889 was discovered at Birr Castle during observation of N3888 and described on March 13, 1852 as "another F, S, 5' nf."  A second observation in 1878 states "Nova, vF, vS, Pos 167.2 deg, Dist 340.5"."  This placed the object southeast of N3888 instead of northeast and in compiling the NGC, Dreyer was swayed by the second observation and placed N3889 just 2 seconds of RA following N3888 and 5.6' south.  There is no object at the NGC position for N3889 but 3.7' northeast of N3888 is located the faint galaxy M+09-19-191 which was visible in my 17.5" scope and is a reasonable match in position and brightness.  In an attempt to identify N3889, the RNGC assigns it the same coordinates and new description as N3850 which is located 17' WSW of N3888!

There was no sign of the central star, though I didn't try higher powers.18" (7/10/05 - Magellan Observatory, Australia): at 76x appears as a bright, beautiful blue cosmic egg floating in a rich star field, ~15" diameter.  Extremely high surface brightness and with a sharply defined edge to the uniformly lit disc.  At 228x, appears to be set in the middle of an absorption hole in the Milky Way as there are very few faint stars in a 4'-5' circular region surrounding the planetary.  Outside this hole, the Milky Way background is very evident and fairly bright.13.1" (2/20/04 - Costa Rica):  at 195x, this 8th magnitude planetary appears as a beautiful 10"-12" blue disc with a very crisp edge.  No central star was glimpsed or other structural details at this magnification though the surface brightness is unusually high.  Situated in a rich star field but set near the middle of a oval 12'-13' ring of mag 11 and 12 stars which are near the periphery of the 17' field at 195x!

The surface brightness is very high and the edge of the halo is crisply defined, but no structural details or central star were noted.  Good response to UHC filter, although it was unnecessary for a good view.  The Milky Way is quite rich here in faint stars but the planetary seems to be set a darker, circular hole without the faint background glow - a contrast affect with the PN?************************************************************NGC 3919 = UGC 06810 = MCG +03-30-119 = CGCG 097-161 = PGC 3703211 50 41.5 +20 00 54V = 13.3;  Size 0.9x0.9;  Surf Br = 13.117.5" (5/4/02): faint, very small, round, 0.4' diameter.

Incorrect identification in the RNGC.In the observation of N3949, the observers at Birr Castle picked up a faint companion described on 31 Mar 1872 as "comp neb n about 2.5'."  A later micrometric observation on 27 Apr 1875, placed this nova in position angle 356.5d, distance 154.6".  Close to Lord Rosse's position there is a very faint galaxy (also catalogued as Ho 301b) which was observable in my 17.5" and verified on the POSS.  Reinmuth also identifies this galaxy as N3950 in his 1926 photographic survey Die Herschel-Nebel.  Corwin notes it is puzzling that this galaxy is only 1.6' N of N3949 although Rosse's two observations place it an extra arcmin north (his other micrometric offsets for nearby stars are very close).RNGC identifies N3950 with another very compact companion located almost 5' north of N3949 which is much further off from the Birr Castle measurements.  The RNGC 1975 coordinates of N3950 should be changed to identify the galaxy at 11h 52.4m +48d 02' and the other columns updated to reflect this change.

Identification not certain.Discovered by JH (h1026) and described as "eF, R, bM, 25".".  In his description he noted "supposed at the time to be II.724 [NGC 3971], but on reducing the obs, it differs 1 min in RA and 1 deg in PD, BOTH which can hardly be mistakes".  Thomson feels that the modern catalogues (including RC3!) are incorrect in selecting N3984 = U06943 = M+05-28-058 = CGCG 157-064 as JH placed N3984 0.1 tmin W of N3986 while U06943 is 1.1 tmin E of N3986.  Thomson concludes that N3984 is nonexistent; see Catalogue and CGCG Corrections.  Not found by Wolf (IC 2 notes).Corwin agrees that the N3984 ­ U06943 but feels that despite the errors in both RA and Dec, N3984 is most likely a reobservation of N3971.  These entries were recorded on different sweeps and although N3971 was described as "pB, R, bM", there are many situations where Herschel made very discordant estimates of brightness.
