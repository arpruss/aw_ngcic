A UHC filter increases the contrast so the disc appears fairly faint to moderately bright (easy with direct vision).  325x provided a good view unfiltered and the elongation appeared closer to WSW-ENE.  The easy central star was visible steadily and the dimensions roughly 45"x35".18" (7/5/05 - Magellan Observatory, Australia): at 228x, this planetary appeared moderately bright, moderately large, elongated 4:3 SW-NE, ~0.8'x0.6'.  Dominated by a mag 13.5 central star with an even surface brightness halo.  Nice contrast gain using a UHC filter at 228x.17.5" (6/30/00): at 220x this fairly faint PN appeared slightly elongated SW-NE, ~50"x35".  The 14th magnitude central star is easily visible encased by an evenly lit disc.  The edges of the halo appear somewhat ragged but the PN is crisp-edged at 280x using a UHC filter.13" (7/5/83): very faint, small, round.  A very faint mag 14 central star is visible.

A mag 14.5 star lies 1' ESE and two additional mag 14.5 stars lie close SE.  Just resolved from HCG 79C which lies 22" west of center.18" (6/20/04): at 320x, a trio of galaxies forming a small equilateral triangle were fairly easily resolved with careful viewing.  The brightest of the trio (HCG 79b) is at the NE corner and appeared elongated 3:2 E-W, ~20"x13".  The other two members (HCG 79a and HCG 79c) are both extremely small, round, ~10" diameter.  Two mag 14.5 stars 1'-1.5' SE are collinear with HCG 79b and a slightly brighter mag 14 star lies 2' W.  In a 30" Starmaster, HCG 79e was barely visible (appeared stellar).17.5" (5/14/88): faint, small, elongated ~E-W.17.5" (6/6/86): this is Seyfert's Sextet = HCG 79, an extremely compact group!  On close inspection, the confused "clump" resolves into three components with the brightest component (HCG 79b) appearing fairly faint, small.  Extremely close are HCG 79a = N6027A just 36" SSW and HCG 79c = N6027B 22" W of center.  A mag 14.5 star is 1.1' ESE and other faint stars are near.  These three galaxies are just resolved at 220x.13" (6/18/85): slightly elongated E-W.13" (5/26/84): faint, very small, irregularly round, weak concentration.Seyfert's Sextet was discovered by Edouard Stephan (XII) in 1882.  Seyfert's name was attached after a paper in 1951.  Although Stephan recorded this ultra-compact group as only a single object, the description "eF, vF* inv, 2 vF st nr" implies he resolved two or probably three member.The GSC position (15 59 12.5 +20 45 49) refers to HCG 79b (most prominent visually). The RNGC does not follow Seyfert's original designations for the members of the group.See Mike Kerr's article which quotes much of my S&T article and more: http://www.asnsw.com/universe/2001/ssmk-0801.htm************************************************************NGC 6028 = UGC 10135 =  MCG +03-41-043 = CGCG 108-063 = I Zw 133 = NGC 6046 = PGC 5671616 01 28.9 +19 21 34V = 13.5;  Size 1.3x1.2;  Surf Br = 13.8;  PA = 30d17.5": faint, very small, round, bright core, faint stellar nucleus.

Incorrect identification in the RNGC and plotted incorrectly on the U2000.The NGC coordinates (obtained by Dreyer from Lewis Swift in private correspondence) are 16 14 25 +62 21 20 (2000).  This object was never formally entered in any of Swift's discovery lists prior to the NGC.  However, in Swift's list IX in Astronomische Nachrichten 3004, he published a corrected position for N6111 (object #57) at 16 14 16 +63 16.2 (2000).  This position corresponds with CGCG 320-014 = M+11-20-007 at 16 14 22.5 +63 15 40 (2000).  His description "D* nr s points to it" clinches the identification as this galaxy is collinear with a faint double star 3' S (mag 13/14.5 at 18"). This galaxy is not identified as N6111 in MCG (M+11-20-007) or CGCG (320-014) and is misplotted on U2000.

Coincidentally, Swift also discovered IC 1210 and it is placed correctly in List IX.  So the position of N6111 should be changed to 16h 14.1m +63 19 (1975) and the data changed to describe CGCG 320-014 = M+11-20-007.************************************************************NGC 6112 = MCG +06-36-017 = CGCG 196-028 = NPM1G +35.0371 = PGC 5776216 18 00.5 +35 06 37V = 13.9;  Size 0.5x0.5;  Surf Br = 12.418" (7/13/07): faint, fairly small, round, 25" diameter, weak concentration.

Incorrect identification in the RNGC.Discovered by Stephan (II) in 187.  His position is roughly 25' W of N6145 within Abell 2197 and there are only faint stars near this position.  RNGC identifies N6138 with the edge-on galaxy MCG +07-34-020, located 7' N of N6145.  Due to the large positional discrepancy with Stephan's generally very accurate position, N6138 should be reclassified as nonexistent.  None of the other modern catalogues have a listing for N6138.

Faintest of trio and situated 1.4' SE of N6145 and 2' NW of N6146 in AGC 2197.  Incorrect identification in the RNGC.The Birr Castle observers examined the N6146 field three times (with no specific measurements) but the sketch from 26 May 1849 shows three galaxies on a line with comments: "2 new neb, alpha eF st, beta S."  Dreyer apparently later added the parenthetical comment "Query h1957 and h1958 and one Nova."Assuming the direction of drift is down (west), then the sketch shows h1957 = N6145 (beta) and h1958 = N6146 (unlabelled) and the third galaxy (alpha in sketch = GC 4196 = N6147) is either MCG +07-34-022 or MCG +07-34-023.  But MCG does not identify either of these faint galaxies as N6147 and both MCG galaxies are missing from CGCG.  Also, MCG +07-34-023 is mentioned as a companion to N6146 in the UGC notes at 2.3', PA = 338d, 0.45x0.40 but again without a NGC designation.Based on RNGC positions, it appears that (R)N6147 = MCG +07-34-022 and (R)N6141 = MCG +07-34-023.  The latter ID is clearly incorrect as Bigourdan's position for N6141 is over 20' southwest, although it also used in the PGC.After two previous failures on N6147, I was successful on 7/24/95 although this galaxy was a marginal glow, about 15" diameter and visible <25% of time with averted vision.  On 7/29/08 this galaxy was easier and visible continuously with averted.  The position was nearly on a line between N6145 and N6146. So I'd suggest N6147 = MCG +07-34-023 although I'm not aware of any modern catalogue that makes this match.  There was no indication of MCG +07-34-022 less than 1' southwest which appears smaller and fainter on DSS.Looking again at the Rosse sketch, there is a faint star (also labelled as alpha) which is placed below (preceding) N6147.  This position corresponds with M+07-34-022, so it very possible that this galaxy was seen as stellar and did not receive a NGC number.************************************************************NGC 6148 = 2MASXi J1627040+240536 = PGC 5816216 27 04.0 +24 05 36V = 16.1;  Size 0.5x0.3;  Surf Br = 13.8;  PA = 60d17.5": not found, 5/28/89.************************************************************NGC 6149 = UGC 10391 = MCG +03-42-011 = CGCG 109-021 = PGC 5818316 27 24.3 +19 35 50V = 13.5;  Size 1.1x0.8;  Surf Br = 13.2;  PA = 22d17.5": faint, very small, round, bright core, stellar nucleus.

The bright nebulosity is split into two large sections by a dark lane which runs N-S.  The eastern portion is the most prominent and includes the scattered cluster N6193 and its three brighter stars (5.6/6.8/7).  On the southern end of this section the nebulosity tapers down towards the SW corner, 15'-20' from the core of the cluster.  The western rim of the nebula is sharply defined with a locally brighter, crisp edge delineated by the dark river which meanders N-S throughout the field.  The eastern and northern ends fade into the rich Milky Way background field.A nearly perfect ellipse of moderately bright stars is just SW of the main body of the cluster and beyond the edge of nebulosity into the rift.  The center of this ring is within the highest contrast portion of the dark rift although the eastern side of the ring intersects the bright edge.  This 15'x10' loop of stars spans the two sections of nebulosity.The western portion of the nebulosity extends mostly NW of the elliptical ring and is clearly fainter.  The highest contrast is along its eastern rim and runs N-S, roughly parallel to its brighter counterpart on the east side of the rift.  The nebulosity fades towards the north and west with no well-defined edge but again is quite extensive.  The catalogued dimensions of 20'x12' are too small and cover only the brightest portion of this much more extension HII/dark nebula complex.8" (7/13/91 - Southern Baja): very large faint nebulosity which envelops open cluster N6193, about 20' diameter.  Extends roughly E-W through the cluster but also a very long brighter streak oriented N-S extends mainly to the south on the west side of cluster.  This streak is well defined with an abrupt edge but there is no contrast gain with a UHC filter.8" (7/16/82): faint, moderately large, low surface brightness glow on the W side of open cluster N6193.

There are also a couple of very faint mag 15 companions to the bright double.  The three bright stars are encased in nebulous halos which respond to UHC filters.  The cluster itself is scattered with no central concentration and includes a mixture of mostly bright and some very faint stars.  A perfect ellipse of moderately bright stars is just SW of the main portion of the cluster.

At 280x, the main portion appears to be a large central bar, 1.5'x1.0', oriented NNW-SSE.  The bar is punctuated by an unusually bright stellar nucleus or a superimposed star at the center.  An extremely faint star is close SSE along the central star.  Off the N end of the bar is a faint appendage or arm is attached that gently curves to the SE and increases the overall dimensions to 2'x1.5' .  Off the SSE end of the bar, some very weak haze extends to the southwest (beginning of an arm).17.5" (7/22/01): fairly bright, fairly large, elongated 2:1 NW-SE, ~2.5'x1.5', small bright core.  Contains a bright stellar nucleus or a star is superimposed at the center of the core.  A very faint star is just off the NW edge.  At the NW end a faint spiral arm is attached to the main body, winding north and then trailing back nearly halfway along the NE flank (this increases the dimensions to ~2.5'x2.0').  With concentration a dark gap is visible between the arm and the main body (bar) of the galaxy.  A very short extension is strongly suggested at the SE end, bending towards the west.  All of these features were sketched and later verified on the DSS.17.5" (5/14/88): bright, fairly large, bright stellar nucleus, elongated.

Two other mag 10-11 stars lie 4' N and 5' ENE of center in the halo.  The core is plastered with an immense number of mag 12.5-13.5 stars and in the central 2' is an incredibly dense mat of mag 13.5 and fainter stars. Very irregular sprays of stars emanate from the central region and form part of the very scraggly outer halo.17.5" (7/15/99): at 220x this bright cluster is highly resolved over the entire disc.  Appears smaller than M10, perhaps 11'-12' diameter with a fairly well-defined 3.5' core.  Two bright field stars are embedded in the north edge of the halo and a third bright star is off the following end.  A mag 10 star is also superimposed just off the SE edge of the core.  A number of brighter resolved mag 12 stars appear to be grouped into pairs and trios.  There are a couple of hundred fainter stars in the central 8' over unresolved haze.  The outline is very irregular and there are distinctive star-poor areas in the outer halo.13.1" (6/19/82) : bright, large, round, very intense core with faint stars scattered over the core.  The outer halo is highly resolved into scores of stars.  Slightly inferior to M10 in faint stars. 8": the outer halo is well resolved and partial resolution of the core.

Very weak concentration with an occasional very faint stellar nucleus.  Can hold steadily with averted vision although not located in any major catalogue.  Located 10' E of N6269 in a group (6th of 8).  Incorrect identification in the RNGC.This galaxy was recorded by first by Marth in 1864 and then by Stephan in 1870 in a group of 7 faint NGC galaxies.

Inspection of the POSS reveals a galaxy at this precise separation from NGC 6269 in the position stated by Marth and Stephan at 16 58 44.0 +27 51 32 (2000).  The RNGC incorrectly selects as its candidate for N6269 an anonymous galaxy catalogued as MCG +05-40-015 which is located 9' E of N6269 but also 14' S!  Discussed in my RNGC Corrections #4.

Incorrect identification (and RA typo) in the RNGC.The entries for N6297 and N6298 are from Swift on 8 July 1885 and 1 Aug 1885 (list II) as a close pair located between two stars with an orientation of SW-NE.  Swift's RA for N6297 was 20 tsec too small, but Bigourdan observed and corrected the RA so the identification is clear.  This galaxy (U10690) is situated between a mag 12 star 1.8' ESE and a mag 13 star 0.9' WNW and is located at 17 03 36.6  +62 01 33 (2000).Bigourdan failed to find N6298 and examination of the POSS reveals there is only a single galaxy between the two stars mentioned by Swift.  RNGC incorrectly identifies N6298 as a member of an extremely faint triple group located 48 tsec of RA following N6297 while Swift's position is just 5 tsec following.  Furthermore, the RNGC has a typo for the RA listing 11h instead of 17h.  Either N6298 is nonexistent or Swift was confused and recorded the same object (also Corwin's conclusion) on the two separate evenings.

In the center is a very high surface brightness "core" of only 10"-12" in diameter that brightens slightly to the center and is encased in a larger, fainter envelope.  Extending from the central core are two remarkable wings oriented WSW-ENE.  The following wing is much shorter but slightly brighter and this extension abruptly shoots towards the SE near the end.  The much longer preceding wing heads WSW and is cut by a darker lane that detaches the western tip.17.5" (6/30/00): at 280x (unfiltered) the Bug Nebula is a remarkable, high surface brightness object, elongated 3:1 WSW-ENE, ~2.0x0.7'.  The intensely bright 10" core appears elongated SW-NE and is offset to the east of center. A quasi-stellar nucleus sharpens to a stellar point when the seeing steadies (this is not the central star, though).  The western wing is longer and is nearly split at the midpoint by a dark slash oriented N-S with a brighter condensation at the west end.  The shorter eastern wing is more pinched and just past its midpoint there is a kink and it angles towards the SE.13.1" (7/27/84): structure highly suspected with the western extension cut by a dark lane.  The eastern extensions bends north following the core.13.1" (7/5/83): bright, fairly small, elongated E-W, very high surface brightness.

The PN is elongated 2:1 NNW-SSE in the direction of the neighboring star.  At the NNW end is the larger and brighter lobe with a smaller, fainter condensation forming the SSE end.  A very faint irregular halo encases the entire structure.  In moments of better seeing (overall seeing poor), the lobes were nearly resolved.17.5" (6/30/00): at 280x using a UHC filter, this bright but compact PN was elongated 2:1 in the direction of a 12th magnitude star at the NNW edge, with dimensions of ~25"x12".  There is a large, bright lobe or condensation at the north end with a smaller, fainter knot at the SSE end.  At moments the lobes appear completely "resolved" with a darker gap in the center.  The view at 500x was excellent!  The fainter southern lobe appears elongated and slightly offset from the major axis of the PN.  The lobes are bisected by a darker lane oriented SW-NE and oblique to the minor axis.  The brighter knot at the north end has a mottled appearance and irregular shape.13" (7/27/84): moderately bright, small, elongated NNW-SSE.  A mag 12 star is at the NNW edge 20" from the center.

At 73x and OIII or UHC filter, the brightest section is on the SE side (N6334 = Gum 62) and consists of a 4'-5' glow extending mostly north of a mag 8.5 star (HD 156738) at 17 20.9 -36 04 (2000).  Appears weaker on the SW side of the star and slightly brighter wrapping around the eastern side of the star.  John Herschel only described this section of the entire complex.A second large section forming the SW component (VdBH 86 = Gum 61) lies 13' to the west and consists of a faint, 5' glow involving a 17" pair (HD 319703 at 17 19.8 -36 06).  This piece is asymmetric and appears as a broad fan sweeping N to SE from the central stars and is very weak or nonexistent to the SW of the stars.A group of smaller pieces forming the NE component (Gum 64b) is 12'-15' N of the brighter SE section.  First is an obvious 2' glow surrounding HD 319702 at 17 20.8 -35 52 (2000).  A small, faint knot of nebulosity lies 3' W, no more than 1' in diameter.  This knot is also situated 2' SSE of a mag 9.5 star that is free from nebulosity.  But to the NW of this star another few arc minutes is a third detached piece of nebulosity, ~2' in diameter (brightest part of Gum 64c).  Very weak nebulosity appears to connect the NE (Gum 64b) with the SE (Gum 62) section.Finally, midway between Gum 64b and Gum 61 a small extremely faint detached glow (Gum 64a) was glimpsed close SE of a star at 17 20.1 -35 58 (2000).13.1" (7/5/83): fairly easy nebulosity surrounds mag 8 star with UHC filter and extends 30' N.

The resolved stars seem spread out over the entire disc which is only weakly concentrated.  The outline of the halo is quite irregular and ill-defined and may reach to a larger extent than 4'.  The cluster is bordered by several brighter stars which are clearly not part of the cluster.  Located just 17' E of mag 4.5 47 Ophiuchi.  Faintly visible in 15x50 IS binoculars.17.5" (7/20/98): at 220x appears as a diffuse irregular glow, ~4' diameter, with only a weak concentration.  Two mag 9 and 10 stars are off the west side, the nearest is less than 4' from center and a closer pair of mag 11.5-12 stars [45" separation] is at the south edge. There are perhaps a half dozen faint but obvious stars visible over the ill-defined glow including a couple of mag 14 stars 2' S of center, one a similar distance east of center and an addition pair on the SE side.  About a dozen stars are visible with careful viewing.  At 280x, the cluster is pretty clumpy and starting to really break up into numerous very faint stars.  Roughly two dozen stars can be glimpsed with averted vision, many near the threshold of visibility.  The full extent of the cluster is difficult to trace but extends beyond the central 4' region.13.1" (7/5/83): large, diffuse, very weak concentration.

I could just barely hold this galaxy continuously with averted vision once it was identified but it took knowing the exact position to initially pick up.  This galaxy is generally identified as N6394. Although Swift's description for N6393 is a better match with this galaxy it's possible that it is too faint for Swift to have picked up.17.5" (6/18/88): not foundSwift recorded N6393 and N6394 on 1885, July 7 (list I).  His position for N6393 is an excellent match with UGC 10889 which is located 3.8' SE of mag 8 SAO 30431 at 17 30 21.4 +59 38 24 (2000).  The brighter (northern) galaxy was apparently also recorded by Swift in his list IX (object 81).N6394 was placed 3.5' due N of N6393 but there is no object at this position on the POSS and Bigourdan was not able to locate a possible candidate.  In an attempt to select an object for N6394, the RNGC indentifies N6394 as MCG +10-25-054, although this faint galaxy is located about 7' SSW of N6393 and is not a viable candidate.   Corwin suggests that despite the poor positions by Swift his original descriptions (not fully given in the NGC) indicates that N6394 = UGC 10889 and N6393 = MCG +10-25-054, although MCG +10-25-054 is quite a faint galaxy to be picked up by Swift.************************************************************NGC 6394 = UGC 10889 = MCG +10-25-055 = PGC 6041017 30 21.4 +59 38 23V = 14.5;  Size 1.3x0.4;  Surf Br = 13.6;  PA = 42d18" (7/30/08): faint, fairly small, very elongated 3:1 SSW-NNE, 0.6'x0.2', very weak concentration.

Three mag 14/15 stars are near the N end.  Located 3.8' SE of mag 8 SAO 30431.  Pair with N6399 11.3' ESE.  This galaxy is identified as N6393 in catalogues, although Corwin identifies it as N6394 based on Swift's description.Discovered by Swift (I).  His position for N6393 matches UGC 10889 = MCG +10-25-055 and that is the identification given in all modern catalogues other than NED.  But Swift's original description for N6394 is an excellent match with U10889 while the description for N6393 matches a much fainter galaxy (MCG +10-25-054) to the south, despite the poor position.

The bright core is relatively large at 4', very lively and granular with a layer of very faint stars.  At 280x, ~30 stars are resolved in the small halo and at the edge of the intense core.  A rich, even sprinkling of faint stars cover the core.  It was difficult to count the resolved stars as numerous dim stars pop out with averted vision over the bright background haze, but perhaps 60-70 stars in total were glimpsed.17.5" (7/16/88): bright, large, 25-30 very faint stars are resolved mostly at the edges which have a ragged appearance. 13" (7/5/83): fairly large, broad concentration.  About a dozen very faint stars are resolved across the disk.

There are four bright mag 6-7 stars in the main group which form a perfect parallelogram with longer sides of 7' oriented WSW-ENE and shorter sides of 4' oriented NW-SE.  A string of stars connects the two stars on the long southern side of the parallelogram (the star at the SE vertex is orange tinged BM Sco) with a nice double star embedded in the string.  The NW vertex is part of a bright isosceles triangle with two mag 8-9 stars and ~7' further NW of this star is a small, nice asterism consisting of a trio and a double.  Also a wedge-shaped group of 7 stars extends between this NW vertex (which also has two additional fainter companions) and the SW vertex (short side of parallelogram) Another distinctive string of stars runs through the center of the parallelogram roughly parallel to the two long sides.  A nice mag 9/10 double resides along the long northern side of the parallelogram.  An additional mag 7 star is the SW of the parallelogram.  Around the main group there are numerous scattered stars and the cluster does not have a distinct border.  Over 70 stars in the cluster are brighter than 11th magnitude.13.1" (7/5/83): very bright, fairly large.  Includes a curving rows of stars and a close group of 7 stars near the center.  The brightest star BM Scorpii is on the E side.  Smaller than M7 but richer.

A mag 14.5 star is just 30" due N.  Due to the faintness of the object, the identification as N6477 is very uncertain.Discovered by Swift (V) on 25 Sept 1886.  This object was described as the 6th of 6 in a faint group including NGC 6456, 6463, 6470, 6471, 6472, and 6477.There are several uncertain or invalid identifications in the RNGC (and other catalogues) including N6470, N6471, N6472 and N6477 because of imprecise coordinates and similar descriptions ("eeeF, eS, R, eee dif") - implying these galaxies were near Swift's visual threshold. The galaxy identified in the RNGC as N6477 is most likely N6472 at 17 44 03.0 +67 37 49 (2000).  This galaxy is 8 tsec of RA following Swift's position of N6472.Corwin proposes that Swift's N6477 may be the galaxy at 17 44 30.6 +67 36 40 (2000, 15 tsec of RA preceding and 1.5' S of Swift's position (17 44 45 +67 38.1).  This galaxy was an a truly marginal object in my 17.5" (see notes) and would not have been picked up without a GSC plot.  It is also possible that Swift mistook a faint star for this object although it appears that Bigourdan also (barely) saw this object (his measured RA is 17 tsec too large).

The NGC identification is very uncertain, as Swift's description does not match the field surrounding MCG +11-22-013.Swift's position is ~8' E of MCG +11-22-013 = CGCG 322-022.  The RNGC and CGCG declination is +64А19' (2000), about 2' N of this galaxy.  Corwin feels this identification is unlikely based on Swift's description.

At 325x a very distinctive 1.5' string or shallow arc of stars is oriented E-W and contains 6 stars (these are possible cluster members).  Within this shallow arc is a 20" knot just east of the midpoint and this is probably the core of the globular.  The entire string is superimposed on a rich Milky Way background so it was very difficult to determine a diameter for the outer halo.17.5" (7/10/99): this interesting globular is located nearly midway along a short 1.5' E-W arc of a half dozen or so mag 13-14 stars that are bowed out to the north.  The globular is a faint, round, 40" glow which is embedded just inside the center of this string which extends beyond the globular to the west and east.  At 100x, this string, along with the haze of the cluster creates the impression the globular is quite elongated.13" (9/3/83): very faint, small, rich spot, slightly elongated E-W, mottled but no resolved.

Surrounding the high surface brightness main body was a thin, very faint outer envelope (inner portion of the outer envelope). The central star was visible continuously. 18" (6/21/03): remarkable view at 538x.

A number of faint stars pepper the interior at 225x, though at this power the group filled the field and was not recognizable at all.  This appears to be a random Milky Way asterism although the triangular outline is somewhat detached in the field at low power.

The main body is only ~8" in size with a thin halo elongated ~SW-NE increasing the size to roughly 15"x11".  It appears to have a much larger, very low surface brightness halo, though perhaps this is scattered light as the planetary has such as a high surface brightness.

Located in the UGC 11156 group and incorrectly identified as UGC 11155 in the RNGC.Discovered by Stephan (I).  The coordinates of his 8th magnitude offset star are off a bit and when this correction is applied (11s of RA and 30" of dec) his micrometric position is 18 12 20.3 +25 39 40 (2000).  This corresponds almost exactly with MCG +04-43-010 = CGCG 142-021 at 18 12 18.4 +25 39 44 (2000).  To further pin down this identification, Stephan's description mentions "between 2 faint stars" and there is a mag 14 star at the northeast end and a mag 15 star at the south end of this galaxy which were recorded in my 17.5" observation. Bigourdan also recorded a "nebulous star" near N6581 although his position for IC 1280 is an excellent match with N6581.  Because of this match, this galaxy is identified as IC 1280 in MCG, CGCG and UGC (notes to U11150) and it seems logical to assume IC 1280 = N6581.  But according to Malcolm Thomson, Bigourdan mentioned both objects in the same observation (could he have mistaken N6581 because of the error in Stephan's position?)The object identified as N6581 in the RNGC is U11155, which is part of a double system with IC 4697 in the UGC 11156 galaxy group and is located 13' S of Stephan's position. Discussed in my RNGC Corrections #4, Thomson's Catalogue Corrections and Corwin's NGCBUGS.************************************************************NGC 6582 = UGC 11146e = MCG +08-33-030 = CGCG 254-023e = VV 818 = NPM1G +49.0376 = PGC 6151318 11 05.2 +49 54 33V = 14.3;  Size 0.6x0.6;  Surf Br = 13.017.5" (7/22/01): the eastern component of this double system is faint, fairly small, round, ~30" diameter.

Reinmuth simply writes "no Cl"  Listed as nonexistent in the RNGC but in Lynga #5 catalogue as OCL-47 = Lund 820.  JH's position is 1.3 tmin E of the Lynga position.  Corwin feels this identification is probably correct. There is really nothing at either position on GSC although 2 tmin W of JH's position is a scattering of bright stars.************************************************************NGC 6606 = UGC 11174 = MCG +07-37-025 = CGCG 227-021 = PGC 6163318 14 41.7 +43 16 07V = 13.6;  Size 0.9x0.7;  Surf Br = 12.9;  PA = 105d17.5" (8/1/89): fairly faint, fairly small, very elongated ~E-W, small very bright core, stellar nucleus, faint extensions.************************************************************NGC 6607 = MCG +10-26-023 = CGCG 301-020 = PGC 6155018 12 14.8 +61 19 59V = 14.6;  Size 0.6x0.5;  Surf Br = 13.317.5" (7/21/98): this very difficult object required averted to glimpse a 15" spot just 2.2' W of brighter N6608.17.5" (6/11/88): extremely faint and small, round.

This galaxy (MCG +10-26-025 = CGCG 301-021) is identified as N6609 in the CGCG.Discoverted by Swift (I).  Both MCG and RNGC identify N6609 with the faint edge-on MCG +10-26-024 = FGC 2194.  The RNGC declination is identical to N6608 although the new description clearly refers to the edge-on 2' S of N6608.  Swift's original position is close following N6608 (not south) and this galaxy was missed with my 17.5" so it seems unlikely Swift could have picked up this extremely faint edge-on.  Also N6607 was described as "eF" and the edge-on would have be more difficult, yet the description reads "vF".

I think that only Malcolm's objects "A" and "B" were seen by Swift, Bigourdan, and Howe.  (Kobold also has an observation of NGC 6677 in the Strassburg Annals, Vol. 3, 1909, but his comparison star has a high proper motion which makes the derivation of an accurate position more difficult.)  I agree with Malcolm that A must be NGC 6677, but am convinced that B is NGC 6679 = IC 4763.  Here's why:1)  As I always do for identification problems, I determined as accurate aposition as I can for every object bearing on an identity question.  In this case, this meant reducing Bigourdan's micrometric observations, and digging positions out of the Guide Star Catalogue.  Here are the results for Malcolm's three objects (positions are for the equinox 1950.0):Galaxy   NGC/IC        RA           Dec       Source   NotesA   N6677              18 33 39.20  +67 04 09.8   GSC                             18 33 38.83  +67 04 11.3   Big      5 Sept 1891 only                             18 33 40     +67 04.1      HoweB   N6679 = I4763  18 33 33.29  +67 05 47.1   GSC                              18 33 33.58  +67 05 44.8   Big                              18 33 35     +67 05.7      HoweC        ---               18 33 34.36  +67 06 21.8   GSCNotice that I have used Bigourdan's observations only from the night of 5 Sept 1891 for NGC 6677.  His observations on 25 June 1897 refer to the star southeast of the galaxy.  I also suspect that his comparison star (BD +66 1115 = GSC 4227-00549) has a relatively large proper motion as there is a systematic offset of +0.24 sec and -7.8 arcsec between his positions and the GSC positions for all the objects for which he used this star as a comparison. I've corrected his positions in the table above for these offsets.The excellent agreement between Bigourdan's, Howe's, and the GSC positions convinces me that the two micrometric observations from each of the early observers do indeed refer to Malcolm's objects A and B.  Furthermore, their descriptions also make sense -- and agree with Swift's -- if we note one additional fact:  object B is in fact a close double galaxy.  Object C is more than 30 arcsec north of B, which puts it much too far away to be part of the object that Howe measured as NGC 6679:  "This is a nebulous D * of mags 12.5, distance 5 arcsec, [position] angle 60 deg."  Bigourdan's description of it as a double star, one that he could not resolve at 344X, also points to the close pair as the actual NGC 6679 -- and adds support to the evidence from his measured position that the pair is equal to Big 333 = IC 4763 (it is, of course, clear that Bigourdan himself realized this).All of this evidence, combined with Swift's own descriptions (in his papers 3 and 9) pin down the identifications without doubt.************************************************************NGC 6680 = CGCG 143-010 = PGC 6221018 39 44.0 +22 18 58V = 14.4;  Size 0.7x0.517.5" (8/1/89): faint, small, round, diffuse, weak concentration.

Bigourdan later corrected Swift's declination based on his 1888, Aug 2 observation, but kept Swift's original separation and orientation.

At 435x roughly three dozen stars are resolved in a 6' region, mostly on the western half of the cluster.  The core is moderately bright but not sharply concentrated.  The irregular halo is peppered with faint stars though at the periphery it was impossible to really distinguish from the numerous faint field stars that surround the cluster.  A dark lane is quite obvious on the south side, appearing to detach the outer section of the halo on the SE side.  The outer halo is poorly resolved on the eastern end.  18" (8/23/03): at 435x, approximately three dozen stars can be counted, although the eastern edge of the halo resists resolution.  A dark lane cuts through the cluster on the south side running SW-NE and detaching a small piece of the halo on the SE side and flattening the central blaze which begins just north of the lane.  IC 1295 lies 24' ESE and both are nicely framed within the field of the 20 Nagler.17.5" (6/29/00): at 220x this is a bright, moderately large cluster, ~6' diameter in a very rich Milky Way field.  Contains a relatively large, intense 3' core with a number of very faint stars peppered over the background glow.  A small, partially resolved piece is detached at the SE end by a dark lane.  The surrounding halo includes a number of brighter stars, though it is difficult to untangle the maze of stars in the halo from the rich Milky Way background.  Roughly 30 stars are resolved at 280x, although it is difficult to accurately count. The core has irregular appearance with a flattened side caused by a sharp light cut off on the south side. PN IC 1295 lies 24' ESE.17.5" (7/1/89): about two dozen stars resolved over haze.  A very rich clump is visible at the west side and a detached clump is at the SE end.  The outline is irregular. 13" (7/27/84): about 15 stars resolved including several extremely faint stars, very mottled, ragged edges, non-symmetric (flattened on the SE side). 8" (7/24/82): grainy, very lively but only a few stars resolved over haze at high power.

Brightest members only V = 15.5.Lies close to the center of the Sagittarius Dwarf Elliptical Galaxy (SagDEG discovered in 1994) and is now thought to be the nucleus of the disrupted galaxy!

Divided in two groups; the SSW group includes a mag 8 star and two mag 10 stars.  A mag 9 star is at the NE edge of the NNW group which also includes several mag 10-12 stars in a curved arc.  Pretty empty between these two groups with just four stars in the center.

The globular appears as an unconcentrated, low surface brightness hazy glow just 1' in diameter but with 5 likely field stars superimposed, giving the appearance of a small open cluster over unresolved background haze.  At 393x, the five mag 13 and fainter stars are grouped into two close pairs with roughly similar separations and orientations.  One pair is near the center (oriented ~N-S) and another is at the NE edge oriented NNW-SSE  (catalogued as IC 4802) while another is at the WNW edge.  The glow of the cluster is irregularly round (slightly elongated E-W) and has a well-defined edge, unusual for a globular.18" (7/19/04): at 225x the view is quite unusual as the glow of the globular is just 2' south of mag 5 Nu 2 Sag.  The globular is just a fairly faint, round 1' glow with a low surface brightness and no evident concentration.  Quite striking, though, are several superimposed stars including a close pair of mag 14 stars at the NE edge.  At 434x, a star near the center is also clearly double and the halo of the globular has a ragged periphery.17.5" (7/20/98): very unusual small, faint glow located 2' south of mag 5 Nu 2 Sagitarii!  The very faint background glow is ~1' diameter but more notable are several superimposed stars.  A close pair of mag 13.5 stars is at the NE edge 25" from center (this is IC 4802!) and a similar star is at the WNW edge 20" from center.  There is a very small bright core which on closer inspection appears to be a close pair of mag 12.5 stars or possibly a bright stellar core and nearby star.  Other than the central "knot", the unconcentrated 1' background patch has a low surface brightness and is much smaller than the listed diameter of 4'.13" (6/18/85): fairly faint, very small.  This globular appears as a hazy patch easily visible just 1.8' S of Nu 2 = 35 Sagitarii (V = 5.0)!

With the 2.5x Powermate, I used 538x, 807x and finally 1087x!  At 538x and 807x, the mag 15.7 central star flicked on and off several times, but only momentarily.  At 1087x, the central star was visible more consistently, flickering on/off regularly and cleanly visible for a few seconds at a stretch.17.5" (6/5/99): Viewed under very steady seeing at 380x.  The halo is elongated 4:3 WSW-ENE and clearly brighter along the north and south sides (minor axis).  The ends of the major axis are clearly "thinner" and slightly fainter at the following end. The interior has a pale gauzy appearance.  The edge of the ring has a "wooly" appearance with a strong impression of small irregular wisps or filaments hinting at the extremely faint outer halo.  The central star popped in and out of view a few times.  A mag 13 star is close off the east side and a very faint mag 15.7 star is a similar distance off the west end.  Another mag 15.6 star is 1' due south of center.  At high power a 3" pair of mag 14-15 stars ~1.3' NNW of center are just resolved with a difficult mag 16.1 star ~30" further north.  On 8/6/02 did not see the mag 16.6 star on the visual sequence chart.17.5" (7/1/89): extremely faint central star visible for moments at 412x just E of center.  The central star was held steadily for a few seconds at best with averted vision.  Forms an unusual pair with the extremely faint galaxy IC 1296 4' NW.13": very bright, moderately large, slightly elongated WSW-ENE, high surface brightness, best example of annularity although interior not dark.  Slightly fainter at ends of major axis.

A single mag 10.5 star is at the NE edge of the halo.17.5" (6/30/00): this is a beautiful, symmetric GC at 220x.  The halo extends to ~6' and is sharply concentrated with a very bright 3' core.  This core is highly resolved into a dense overlay of faint stars with a single brighter star just north of center.  The extent of the halo is ill-defined and consists of numerous brighter stragglers (or field stars) mixed with a sprinkling of dim stars.  Perhaps 70 stars are resolved in total.  In a remarkable region with a complex of unusual reflection nebulae (N6726/27/29).17.5" (7/29/92): at 220x, bright, fairly large with about 50 stars visible in a 4'-5' diameter.  Fairly symmetric appearance with no distinct edge.  Beautifully resolved into several dozen stars.  A mag 10.5 star is off the NE edge 3' from the core.  Mildly concentrated but no distinct nucleus although a star appears embedded at the center of the core.  The outer halo is well-resolved and a peppering of stars are resolved over the core.  In the same low power field with bright nebula N6726, N6727, N6729 to the SE!13.1" (8/24/84): at 220x many faint stars resolved beyond the main disc.13.1" (5/26/84): bright, large, mottled, many faint stars resolved across disc and at edges of halo.13.1" (8/15/82): a number of very faint stars resolved around the periphery at 140x.8" (7/31/81): bright, large, bright core, mottled, some resolution of extremely faint stars around edges.************************************************************NGC 672418 56 46 +10 25.7Size 317.5" (7/24/95): at 100x appears as a small indistinct group in a rich Milky Way field.

At 435x, the surface brightness is irregular and there is an impression that an extremely faint star or knot is superimposed on the north side or perhaps the rim is irregularly brighter along the north side.  The planetary is bracketed by two stars just off the leading and trailing sides.18" (9/20/03): moderately bright, round, 20" planetary.  Excellent view at 435x; the halo has a subtle irregular surface brightness and seems slightly fainter near the center and it also appears to fade slightly at the edge of the halo. The mag 14.5 central star shines steadily.  Situated in a rich star field with a mag 13.5 star at the east edge with fainter stars off the west side.

At 128x, this naked-eye cluster seemed fully resolved with an uncountable number of stars densely packed over a large region.  Streamers in the halo greatly increase diameter to roughly 20'.  The central region is well-compressed to a very bright core.  There is a strong 3-dimensional effect as the core is covered with scores of fairly bright stars seemingly superimposed over a rich mat of fainter stars and all set over a background glow.  The nucleus is small and very bright.  Many 11th-12th magnitude stars in the halo form complete loops and long chains.  A mag 7.7 double star is superimposed on the SW edge of the halo (h5085 = 7.7/9.2 at 2.8").  This was one of my favorite objects from Australia!12" (6/29/02 - Bargo, Australia): this naked-eye cluster ranks second in terms of brightest members (mag 11.5). The 4' core has several dozen mag 12-13 stars, many arranged in streaming curves and chains layered over a dense central glow.  The halo is large but irregular with knots of mag 11-12 stars over a diffuse background.  The brighter members, particularly in the outer halo give the visual appearance of a globular embedded in a larger, open cluster!8" (7/13/91 - Southern Baja): very bright, fairly large, 10' total diameter with a 2' brighter core which increases to very bright nucleus.  The large halo is very mottled and partially resolved although viewed at only 6 degrees elevation as the brightest stars are mag 11.  15-20 stars mag 11-12 are visible around the edges of the core and within the halo in curved strings.

The view is confused, though, as a star or knot in directly involved at the NE end along with 1 or 2 additional stars around the edges.  Excellent contrast gain with an OIII filter as the edges sharpen up and the halo is elongated 2:1 SW-NE, ~0.6'x0.3'.  At 225x, a mag 14-15 star is just off the NE end and the involved knot seems to occasionally resolve into a couple of faint stars just north of center near the NE edge.  Finally, an extremely faint star occasionally sparkles at the SW end.17.5" (9/5/99): picked up at 100x as a small, irregular glow in a rich star field by moving 20' NW of и2483 = 7.9/9.0 at 10".  At 220x, the PN is clearly elongated ~2:1 SW-NE.  The appearance is odd with a much brighter NE end and a fainter extension to the SW end.  A mag 14.5-15 star is just off the NE end in the direction of the elongation.  At 380x, a very faint star was intermittently glimpsed within the NE end.  If this is the central star it is very eccentrically placed.13" (6/18/85): faint, elongated SSW-NNE, appears similar to a diffuse galaxy.  A faint mag 14.5 star is at the NE tip.

Appears moderately bright, round, fairly large, ~60" diameter.  The rim is sharply defined and slightly brighter with a subtly darker center giving a weak annular impression.18" (8/23/03): at 215x with a UHC filter, this planetary appears as an irregular, 60" disc, slightly elongated N-S.  The rim is slightly brighter, particularly along an arc from the SW to the N side, giving a weakly annular appearance.  At 538x the view is too dim but I noticed a couple of extremely faint stars along the edge of the rim.17.5" (9/5/99): easily picked up at 100x as a 1' disc, appearing slightly irregular.  Best view at 220x and 280x using a UHC filter.  The disc was quite irregular in surface brightness and slightly elongated N-S.  Most notably, the rim is generally brighter along the northern side in a broad "U" shape with the center weakly annular.  The south rim of the planetary is fainter and less well defined.  No central star seen at 380x.13" (8/8/86): moderately bright, slightly elongated N-S, estimate V = 13.0.

Excellent view at 435x with an irregular shape slightly elongated ~E-W, ~25"x20".  A brighter knot at the west end gives the appearance of being double or bipolar.  At 565x the surface brightness is noticeably irregular and an extremely faint star was occasionally visible at the west edge and also fleeting glimpses of a centrally located star.  17.5" (9/5/99): fairly bright, but small disc picked up at 100x.  Easily takes high power. Nice view unfiltered at 280x - the PN has an irregular surface brightness with a brighter center but no central star and appears slightly elongated WNW-ESE, perhaps 20"-25" in diameter.

The rim is clearly brighter, paricularly along the entire south side, with the rim fading on the north side giving an asymmetric or crescent appearance. A large central "hole" appears slightly  darker.  At 160x, one or possible two extremely faint stars flickered on and off within the interior of the disc but neither appeared to be the central star.17.5" (6/30/00): at 220x unfiltered this fairly bright PN has a 1.5' round halo.  The rim is brightest and more well-defined along an arc on the S and SE rim.  The central 45" hole is slightly darker and irregular in surface brightness.  A mag 13 star is at the NE edge and once or twice I caught a fainter glimmer of an interior star north of center. 17.5" (7/12/99): at 100x appears fairly bright, round, ~1.6' diameter with a darker center.  I used a variety of magnifications and filters but the most interesting view was at 220x using a UHC filter.  With this combination the PN is slightly elongated E-W and clearly brighter along the southern rim with the brightening tapering towards the ends so this brighter portion had a crescent appearance.  Because of this asymmetric rim the darker center seems offset and only weakly brightens at the NW rim.  A mag 13 star is just off the NE edge 1' from center.17.5" (8/2/86): at 222x and UHC filter; very large, about 1.8' diameter, much brighter on the SW portion of the rim, darker center.

Incorrect identification in the RNGC, SGC, ESO-LV.On 30 July 30 1834, JH reported the discovery of a galaxy at 19 43 59.5 -28 33 04 (2000)  Near this position are two galaxies with a 5' separation; E460-G29 at 19 43 59 -28 29.2 (2000) and E460-G30 at 19 44 02 -28 24.1 (2000).  RNGC, ESO, RC3 and PGC identify N6816 = E460-G30, although if you compare Herschel's coordinates the southern galaxy E460-G29 is a better match.RNGC and ESO were probably influenced by the GC and NGC description of N6816 that mentions a "* north preceding."  There is a 9th magnitude star just W of E460-G30 and a close pair of faint stars on the west and northwest edge of the galaxy.  E460-G29 is located 5' S of this 9th magnitude star.But John Herschel's original Cape observation reads "eF, R, vlbM, 40", a *9 magnitude north of it, at 6' distance has what may be easily taken for a nebula attached to it, but it is only a little group of vS stars."  Based on this description, there can be no doubt that the southern galaxy E460-G29 = N6816.

At 220x, it appeared as a small, 20" knot of nebulosity surrounding a faint stellar or quasi-stellar core.  Interestingly, this object dimmed with OIII, UHC and H-beta, so it's likely a reflection nebula that is detached from the main mass of nebulosity to the NE.13.1" (8/15/82): cluster encased in nebulosity using a filter and averted vision.

Without a filter a mag 13 (illuminating?) star is visible at the center and two stars are at opposite edges (SW and NE).  At 280x the outline surface brightness is slightly irregular.  Located just inside a beautiful partial ring or loop of stars that includes a couple of double stars.  While viewing this object I noticed a fairly large, 3' low surface brightness hazy region about 10' W in the field.  This glow matches the location of Sh 2-99 (11' W of N6857).  There was no structure to this HII region and the surface brightness was uniform.  18" (9/25/06): easily swept up at 115x as a small, high surface brightness nebula, roughly 1' in diameter, situated in a rich star field.  Excellent contrast gain with an OIII filter and appears quite bright with this combination.  At 300x, the nebula appears as a 1'-1.5' bright glow that spreads out mostly to the south of an embedded (possibly illuminating) mag 13.5-14 star in an irregular shape.  This HII region is located along one side of a near equilateral triangle of mag 12-13 stars with a mag 12 star just 40" SW.  A close, faint equal pair of mag 13.5 stars follows by 4'.17.5" (8/7/91): very bright, moderately large, about 1' diameter, irregular outline, roughly circular but edges difficult to define, irregular surface brightness.

This huge barred spiral (with excessively distended arms spanning roughly 750,000 light years) appeared moderately bright, fairly small, elongated 2:1 SW-NE in the direction of a mag 10.4 star 1.1' WSW of center, ~1.2'x0.6', broad concentration with a brighter core.  Interacting with IC 4970 at 1.1' N just outside the halo while fainter PGC 64439 lies 4.0' SE.

There is a 15' string starting from the mag 10 star at the NGC position going due W and ending at the bright double и2631 = 8.4/9.8 at 4.6".  This star is very possibly the double referred to in John Herschel's description with a 1.0 tmin error in RA -- Corwin concurs.17.5" (7/7/94): the low power field (100x using 20 Nagler) surrounding the pretty double star Theta Sagittae = и2637 (6.5/9.0 at 12") includes several bright stars but appears too sparse to be a cluster.  But 5' NE of Theta is a neat elongated group of 15 stars mag 12-13 forming a "?" asterism about 6' in length.  Theta Sagittae is located 1.7 tmin E and 11' S of Herschel's position so this identification is less likely than the one given above.Discovered by JH (h2068 = и2631): "A double star the chief of a coarse straggling group of stars 10...13m hardly entitled to be called a cluster." JH's position (h2068) of 20 08 14 +21 06.4 (2000) is exactly 1.0 tmin  E of the bright double и2631 = 8.4/9.8 pair at 4.6" separation.  Coincidentally his position falls on a mag 10 star, although it does not appear to be double. Described by Reinmuth as "a dense region; no Cl; double star 11.8 in Dreyer's place."  In Deep Sky #31, Summer 1990, Skiff identifies the double star involved with the group as Theta Sge = и2637 = 6.5/9.0 at 12" and 7.4 at 84" which is located at 20 09 56 +20 54.9.  "A sparse group centered on Theta Sge, which is the pair mentioned in the NGC description, and is clearly observable in my 6" refractor."  This group is more visually prominent (see visual notes from 7/7/94) but does not correspond with John Herschel's position.  Brent Archinal concurs that the Theta Sge group is not N6873.Corwin: JH's position (and so GC and NGC) is 1 minute of time too large.  The correct position for и2631 (the double star noted in the description) puts it into the midst of a relatively rich Milky Way field.  But JH is right in calling it "... a coarse straggling group of stars 10...13m, hardly entitled to be called a cluster."  The grouping is approximately 13 arcmin x 10 arcmin with a center of gravity just south of the double very close JH's position corrected by 1 minute in RA.************************************************************NGC 6874 = Basel 6 = OCL-157 = Lund 30420 07 33 +38 14.8V = 7.7;  Size 817.5" (8/25/95): large, fairly rich and uniform triangular group.

About 15 stars in a tight 2' knot with three close brighter stars on the W side, over unresolved haze.  Sprays of stars forming the outline of N6885 seem to radiate from this group.  N6682 and N6885 appear as one cluster at low power.  It's very possible that N6882 = H VIII 22 is a duplicate observation of N6885 and does not refer to a distinct object.  In that case, this subgroup would be identified as Cr 416.  See Corwin's NGCBUGS for story.8" (8/23/84): in the field of N6885 to the north with a mag 7 star surrounded by five faint stars.  Two additional mag 7 stars are nearby.From Brent Archinal 6/99H.VIII.22 = GC 4557 = NGC 6882 - William Herschel recorded this object on September 10, 1784. He listed it as of class VIII, i.e. a "coarsely scattered cluster of stars", with position 1m12s following and 0d 12' south of 18 Vul. His description is "A Cl. of co. sc. st.". We have for the position:18 Vul (2000.0) 20 10 33.54 +26 54 15.018 Vul (1784.694) 20 01 34.72 +26 16 38.3 H. offset + 1 12 -00 12NGC 6882 (1784.694) 20 02 47 +25 04.6NGC 6882 (2000.0) 20 11 53 +25 42.5Of course, the problem is there really is nothing quite like what Herschel described at his given position. His position matches that of object "c" above, and for some time I was ready to adopt this as the correct object. However, Harold Corwin [e-mail of July 23, 1998] has convinced me otherwise. Clearly "c" is not a class VIII object, and does not really match the description of a "coarsely scattered cluster". It seems more likely that Herschel simply made an approximately 15' mistake in the declination, and in fact this object is group "a". Group "b" does not seem to be a likely candidate, since it is small enough and has faint enough stars to also not match as class VIII object or Herschel's description. So, the identification H.VIII.22 = NGC 6882 = object "a" seems likely, but as Corwin has pointed out, we'll probably never know for sure.************************************************************NGC 6883 = Cr 415 = Lund 929 = OCL-15220 11 19.8 +35 49 55Size 1518" (10/8/05): at 115x, 60 stars over haze are visible in a 6' group that is set in an incredibly rich Milky Way field.  Five of the brighter stars on the south side form an elongated "Y" or "Wishbone" asterism with a bright pair of mag 9.5/10 stars (17" separation) at the base of the wishbone.  The west side of the cluster is defined by a gently curving string of 10 faint stars.  At 220x, up to 80-90 stars can be counted in an 7'x5' region as a number of faint star emerge from the background.  At low power this region by other concentrations or asterism including Ruprecht 172 which spreads out to the southeast.17.5" (8/19/95): two dozen stars in a 4' diameter surrounding a prominent "Y" asterism of five mag 10 stars with twenty additional mag 13-14.5 stars.  The brightest star at the base of the "Y" is a mag 9.5/10 double at 17" and the center star about 1.5' NE is an unequal closer pair.  Surrounding this group is a oval border of 7' diameter consisting of several strings of mag 13 stars which increase the total to roughly 50 stars.  Appears to be an asterism in a rich Milky Way field and best view at 100x.  Attached to Ruprecht 172.8 (8/15/82): elongated string of stars N-S, moderately large, over background haze.

Includes the bright star 20 Vulpeculae (V = 5.9) surrounded by seven very faint stars in the SE corner of the cluster.  Weak in the center of the triangle except for about 10 other stars.  A wide bright pair is at the E vertex and a wide unequal double star is at the SW side.

A small disc <10" diameter is visible at  220x without filter.  Situated at the NW vertex of a small isosceles triangle with a mag 11 star 0.8' SSE and a mag 10 star 1.6' E.  The nearer star is double with a faint companion close north.  N6886 is clearly non-stellar at 280x-380x and slightly oval.13" (9/29/84): fairly bright, very small, just non-stellar at 166x.  At 415x, easily visible small disc elongated ~E-W.  Forms the NW vertex of a thin isosceles triangle with a mag 10.5 star 45" SSE and a mag 10 star 1.5' E.

A very faint hazy glow with no structure completed most of a large oval.18" (8/23/03): Using a 6-inch off-axis mask with a 31 Nagler (73x) and an OIII filter, a faint curving arc is visible which begins SW of the mag 7.2 star on the north edge and curves around to the mag 8.2 star on the NE side, extending nearly 90А of arc along the annulus of the Crescent Nebula.  No other nebulosity was visible.17.5" (6/29/00): Stunning view at 100x (20mm Nagler) using an OIII filter.  The outline appears as a huge, irregular cosmic egg, ~18'x11', floating in a very rich Cygnus star field.  The complete annulus is easily visible.  The brightest section is along the north side and passes through a mag 7.2 star at the north edge.  This piece displays much structure with several knots and wispy tendrils.  An isolated bright knot is within the weakly glowing interior and is collinear with the mag 7.2 star and the mag 7.4 central star. The interior has an irregular surface brightness with wispy striations that appear to radiate from the central star towards the NW rim at the end of the bright arc.  The rim is widest on the SW end with more nebulosity filling in towards the center.  The fine texture and structure of the nebulosity creates a 3-dimensional feel and an "electric" effect.17.5" (7/5/86): the "Crescent Nebula" is one of my favorite large nebulosities at 100x with a OIII filter (excellent contrast gain).  Appears as a bright, 16'x11' oval or egg-shaped annulus elongated SW-NE.  The rim is virtually complete except for a small piece of the east side and exhibits a great deal of turbulent, wispy structure.  Brightest just SW of mag 7.2 HD 192182 (unequal pair Oи 401 = 7.2/10.5 at 14") which is embedded in the rim at the north end.  The nebula also passes through mag 8.2 SAO 69611 on the NE side.  Just north of center in the interior is the mag 7.4 Wolf-Rayet star HD 192163 = WR 136, whose strong stellar wind created this shocked ring-type nebula.  This is beautiful nebulosity set in a very rich Milky Way field.13" (9/11/82): bright, large, oval shell, nearly complete loop visible with UHC, striking unusual appearance! 8" (8/9/80): faint, elongated arc of nebulosity connecting two mag 7.5/8.5 stars and extending SW of the brighter star.

In the 18-inch at 225x, the bright, blue disc of high surface brightness surrounds the central star.  At 300x the very bright oval disc of 8"x6" diameter is surrounded by a fainter, round outer envelope that increases the diameter to ~15".  With direct vision the central star is visible embedded in the center of the high surface brightness disc.  A mag 12.5 star lies 1' WNW and a mag 13 star is a similar distance ESE with N6891 nearly at the midpoint.18" (7/15/07): at 174x this small blue disc has a high surface brightness and is very prominent in the field.  With direct vision the mag 12.5-13 central star is easily visible.  At 280x appears as a very bright, small disc with an unusually high surface brightness and the central star shines steadily.  At 700x, the extremely bright inner region is slightly elongated or lens-shaped N-S and is surrounded by a fainter outer halo or envelope that is still quite evident.17.5" (8/27/87): very bright at 140x and OIII filter.  Appears as a small high surface brightness bluish oval of 10"-15" diameter.  At 410x, a brighter center or mag 13 central star is visible.

The brightest piece (GN 20.22.9) was discovered by Stephan and is located 11' SW of mag 6.9 HD 194708.  It involves two mag 11 stars and a mag 12.5 star on the west side.  About 6' S is another hazy patch (vdB 132 = GN 20.23.0) surrounding a wide mag 9/11 pair at 43".  Faint haze connects these two pieces and together they extend ~10'x3' in a N-S orientation.  This reflection nebula appears to be bounded on the west side by a non-illuminated dust cloud.A third weak reflection nebula (VdB 131) is located 12' SSW of the brighter (northern) section of N6914.  It involves a group of 10-15 stars (Dolidze 8) including two mag 9.5 stars and a nice curving arc of stars is just off the southeast side.  Overally, the Milky Way is very patchy or dusty in this region so these reflection nebulae do not stand out prominently, though the contrast was improved using a Deep Sky filter.To the SE of the N6914 complex is a very faint, hazy HII region (LBN 279), situated just east of mag 7.5 HD 194669.  It appears roughly 10'x6' in size and includes a number of mag 10-11 stars.  There was only a weak response to a UHC filter, though there was no response to a Deep Sky filter and this is not part of the reflection complex.17.5" (8/7/91): at 100x appears as a fairly bright field of reflection nebulosity locally brightest surrouding two pairs of fairly bright stars.  Two mag 11 stars are at the N end with a separation of 51" and a mag 9 (SAO 49589)/mag 11 pair with a separation of 42" is at the south end.  These two sections are separated by ~6' and are connected by a fainter elongated piece of nebulosity.  Very faint nebulosity also extends NE towards a mag 7 star (SAO 49603) located 11' NE.  Stephan's position is centered on the northern pair of stars.  A third piece surrounding a mag 9 further SW was not noted.8" (7/24/82): fairly large nebulous field locally brighter surrounding a wide faint double star and to the south surrounding a double star mag 9.

It was fairly easy to identify using a mag 13/13.5 pair of stars [18" separation].  The cluster is located 1.5' NW of the fairly wide double.  At 280x, the cluster appeared as a very faint, hazy glow, ~0.3' diameter.18" (7/31/05): using the photographic finder chart in Astrophysical Journal (Vol  535: 748-758, 2000) titled "A Young Globular Cluster in the Galaxy NGC 6946", I tracked down this 15 million year old supermassive star cluster or young globular.  This object is located 2.8' W of the core and 1.5' NW of a wide, unequal pair of stars.  On the DSS, it appears to be located near the end of a faint arm (not seen) that attaches to the core on the south side and extends to the west.  Using the image, I quickly pinpointed the location and at 323x a very faint, small, roundish glow of ~15" diameter was visible.  This very low surface brightness spot was visible 80-90% of the time with averted vision once identified and appeared similar to a faint Abell planetary.  Without the finder chart, I would probably have passed over this object without noticing it, and in fact missed it in my observation from the White Mountains in 8/29/02.  Using ALADIN, the position of the young globular is 20 34 31.7 +60 08 17.18" (10/9/04): viewed type II supernova 2004e, discovered 9/27/04 (13 days ago) and appearing at approximately mag 12.8.  It was easily identified using a photographic finder chart.  The supernova is located 4.1' E and 1.9' S of the nucleus, just west of a pair of mag 13/13.5 stars at 12" separation and was comparable to the brighter star of this pair.  A fainter mag 14.4 star is close WSW and the three stars plus supernova form a small wedge or Sagitta shaped group.  This is the 8th supernova discovered in N6946 since 1917.17.5" (8/29/92): bright, very large, 6' diameter to main body, elongated 3:2 ~E-W.  Three arms are visible.  A long bright arm is attached at the north side of the core and trails to the east.

On the west side a fainter arm shoots sharply to the north from the core.  These outer arms significantly increase the diameter of the main body.  The galaxy has a very large brighter middle but the core is just a very small brighter region close SW of the geometric center.  A very faint stellar nucleus was seen with direct vision.  Observation from 12,000' in the White Mountains.17.5" (8/13/88): main spiral arm very prominent and easily seen to split.17.5" (9/14/85): bright, large, brighter central core.

Three equal mag stars are collinear on the E side and a mag 8.5 star is on the SW side.  There are no dense knots or a core and this collection of stars barely stands out in the field.At William Herschel's original position and description (VIII 76) is a scattered group of stars involved with IC 5076 and mag 5.7 SAO 50246.  Nebulosity (IC 5076) is visible on the west side of a striking 5' group of stars centered on the bright star.

Appears very bright, extremely large, very elongated, about 1А length, crossed by darker rifts.  Feather-like side branches are at the south edge running off towards the west.  Breathtaking filamentary detail at 83x is too intricate to describe using an OIII filter particularly on the southern half!

Not noticed initially near position, but once identified could just hold steadily with concentration.  The identification of this galaxy with N6993 is not certain, but it roughly matches Leavenworth's field sketch and description.Discovered by Leavenworth (list 1).  Not found by ESO or RNGC.  Wolfgang Steinicke initially identified N6993 with a faint galaxy at 20 59 30.0 -25 41 00, which matches Leavenworth's rough position.Corwin: Since you sent that note last weekend, I've had a chance to look at the galaxy again.  There is indeed a sketch and it does not  match the galaxy and star field at all.  Leavenworth's object is brighter and has several stars around it, and he comments about an envelope of 15th magnitude.  This also rules out the faint object near his position which has no corona, let alone one as bright as 15.However, ESO 529-G011 = MCG -04-49-007 (5.5 minutes west and 13 arcmin north of Leavenworth's position) and its surrounding stars match the sketch pretty well (though the "stars" are small enough and displaced enough from their true positions that I thought at first sight that they might be photocopy defects), and the description matches perfectly.  I think this is probably the correct identification, so I've put it into my files.  But a visual confirmation would be valuable.************************************************************NGC 6994 = M73 = Cr 42620 58 56 -12 38 07V = 9.7;  Size 317.5" (9/7/91): four stars in a "Y" asterism.

Stands out somewhat in the field but not striking.  Located on the north (Canada) side of the North America Nebula.  More interesting is that on the east side of the group and curving around the north side is a well-defined fairly high contrast dark nebula (Barnard 353).  I had the impression that the stars in the "cluster" were perhaps an absorption hole in this dark cloud.17.5" (9/23/95): about 50 stars mag 10 and fainter within an 8'-10' group in the NE part of the North American nebula.  Fairly well-detached and distinguishable in a low power field but appears to be a typical Milky Way cloud with no particular dense spots.  Situated about 10' NW of a striking equilateral triangle of mag 8/9 stars with sides 2' (center at 20 57.0 +45 19).  Barnard 353 (low contrast) is just following. The RNGC misidentifies N6997 as N6696.Discovered by JH (h2094) and observed twice: "Coarse, poor, pL cluster, stars small." The RNGC dec is 50' too small and the position corresponds with N6997 so the RNGC has apparently misidenified N6997 as N6996 (error originated in Hogg).

The SW end of the major axis has a fainter condensation and the rim is clearly dimmest near the double star.  The mag 14 central star shines steadily as does a slightly fainter mag 14.5 on the NE edge.  Just off the west edge is another 14th magnitude star.  The darker center is faintly luminous and the surface brightness is irregular over the entire oval giving a mottled, wispy appearance.13" (9/11/82): bright planetary with unusual structure and several stars involved.

A wide dark lane intrudes into the nebulosity from the southwest towards the bright star.  To the south of the star is a triangular region of haze (brightest just south of the central star) roughly filling in the region defined by a mag 13.5 star 5.5' SSE and a fainter star a similar distance SW.  Seemingly detached at the periphery is a larger section of faint haze on the east side of the nebula that is extended N-S (this is an outer "wing" on photographs) and a more vaguely defined region of low surface brightness haze detached on the western side (also oriented N-S).  These two detached wings give a diameter of at least 7'.17.5" (8/13/88): very prominent unusual nebulosity surrounding mag 7.4 SAO 19158.

Both knots are lively or mottled and slightly tapered in shape.  Both contain stellar nuclei or points near their centers with the western nucleus slightly easier.  The eastern lobe is barely larger and brighter.  The lobes are nearly tangent but just separated by a darker lane and both lobes are encased on a common halo.  At 807x, the two lobes are clearly separated by a dark lane (the Cheeseburger's "patty") oriented SSW to NNE.  A mag 10.5 star is off the NE side, less than 30" from the center.  Located 13' NNW of mag 4.6 73 Cyg.17.5" (7/9/99): fascinating object at 380x both with and without a UHC filter.  The double-lobed structure is clearly visible with the western lobe slightly elongated N-S and containing a brighter center.  The eastern knot also has a quasi-stellar center at moments using direct vision and the knot has an irregular outline.  Using the UHC, the lobes are more cleanly separated and the small fainter halo that encases the two bright lobes is more obvious.  A mag 11 star is just 0.5' NE of center.  Located 12.5' NNW of mag 4.7 63 Cygni.13" (9/3/83): at 333x appears fairly bright, very small, elongated WSW-ENE.

At 175x in the 18-inch, appears as a small, very high surface brightness oval with a blue-green color.  At 450x, this planetary is elongated 3:2 NW-SE, ~18"x12" and has an unusual bipolar appearance with two lobes.  The 10" NW component has a very high surface brightness and contains a quasi-stellar brighter knot on its west edge.  A fainter lobe juts out towards the SE and is slightly smaller (~8").  At 565x the SE lobe seems incomplete as if it was partially obscured and two lobes are encased in a thin outer envelope.  The view was fascinating at 807x with the sense of peering at a 3-dimensional object - the brighter NW lobe being closer and the partially overlapping SE lobe extending away in space.  At this power both lobes were clearly irregular in shape and surface brightness.17.5" (10/2/99): At 100x, the small greenish disc is very prominent but at higher powers appears bluish.  Easily takes very high power and the view unfiltered at 380x and 500x was striking.  Appears elongated 3:2 NW-SE, 0.3'x0.2', with two distinct lobes.  The NW knot is slightly brighter and at times a stellar spot or star appears embedded at its SW tip.  At 500x, the two knots are encased in a very small common halo which extends further out on the north side.  The southern edge of both knots has a sharp, flat appearance.13" (9/11/82): at 288x; small, bright, unusually high surface brightness, elongated NW-SE.

Interestingly, there is a large, fairly bright and rich star field about 30' SW centered about 21 16.5 +57 28" (2000) which appears to be a cluster but is not listed in the Lynga catalogue.************************************************************NGC 7056 = UGC 11734 = MCG +03-54-008 = CGCG 449-019 = IC 1382 = PGC 6664121 22 07.5 +18 39 56V = 12.9;  Size 1.0x0.9;  Surf Br = 12.717.5" (8/2/86): fairly faint, small, almost round.  A small brighter core appears offset to the W which gives the impression that the galaxy is slightly elongated.************************************************************NGC 705821 21 39.8 +50 50 1717.5" (8/25/95): bright, scattered group including mag 7.9 SAO 33352 and four other mag 9.5-10 stars in a 4'-5' region forming the borders of the group. There are roughly two dozen stars mag 13-14.5 in the immediate vicinity but the density of the fainter stars is actually lower than other rich regions in the same low power field.  So, only distinguishable because of the grouping of brighter stars which may form a physical group.  Listed as nonexistent in RNGC.************************************************************NGC 7062 = Cr 434 = Lund 988 = OCL-20521 23 27 +46 22.7V = 8.3;  Size 717.5" (8/7/91): about 30 stars mag 10 and fainter in a 5' diameter at 220x.  The brightest stars form a parallelogram enclosing the cluster.  A mag 10 star is at the east end and a mag 11 star is at the west end.

Very bright, fairly large, elongated ~N-S.  Includes about ten bright stars mag 9-10.5.  This is a scattered group with no rich sections.  A line of four bright stars is at the west edge and a curving arc of bright stars is just following.  Includes a triple star consisting of a close well-matched mag 12.5 double star and a wider third member.************************************************************NGC 7065 = MCG -01-54-017 = NPM1G -07.0504 = PGC 6676621 26 42.4 -06 59 43V = 13.3;  Size 1.1x0.8;  Surf Br = 13.0;  PA = 25d17.5" (9/15/90): fairly faint, extremely small, round, bright stellar nucleus or star superimposed, just non-stellar (only core visible).  Located 4.7' WSW of mag 8.8 SAO 45403 and 10.3' W of mag 7.6 SAO 45409.  Forms a pair with N7065A 4.2' ESE.The RNGC positions are offset 2' S from the GSC 2000 positions given below:N7065   21 26 42.4 -06 59 42  =M-01-54-017N7065A  21 26 57.8 -07 01 18  =M-01-54-018Coincidently, this causes the RNGC declination to actually match that of N7065A although the RNGC orientation is correct.Dreyer attributed N7065 to both Marth (m440) and d'Arrest although he noted a slight discrepancy in their position.  He decided to use d'Arrest's position in NGC.  Their positions for 2000 are:m440   21 26 58 -07 02d'A    21 26 45 -07 00.1Comparing these positions with the GSC strongly suggests that while d'Arrest observed the galaxy identified as N7065, Marth actually recorded the companion galaxy N7065A!  Both of these faint galaxies were visible in my 17.5" and neither was significantly more prominent.  So, it is possible that N7065A = M-01-54-018 should have been included by Dreyer as a separate entry from Marth.The RNGC positions for N7065/7065A are 2' too far S and listed in RNGC Corrections #4.************************************************************NGC 7066 = UGC 11741 = MCG +02-54-025 = CGCG 426-054 = II Zw 130  = PGC 6674721 26 13.8 +14 10 57V = 13.8;  Size 1.0x1.0;  Surf Br = 13.617.5" (8/2/86): fairly faint, very small, elongated, stellar nucleus.

Appears evenly illuminated at low power.  Viewed unfiltered at 160x and a couple of faint stars are embedded, one at the east edge and another at the north.  Only a weak contrast gain using the OIII filter and easier to view unfiltered at 225x.  At this power the shape appears irregular and brighter along the east side.  Neither of the two stars appear to be the central star as they're situated near the edge of the halo.  A number of 13-15th magnitude stars are in the field including a couple of 14th mag stars 1' and 2' N and a small, fainter trio close west.

Located 15' SE of mag 7.2 SAO 19386.  Identified as Abell 75 in CGPN and ESO-Strausberg catalogues.This object was first recorded by WH as III 936.  His position was 7 min 54 sec following Alpha Cephei and 16' north.  This places it at 21 26.5 +62 51 (2000).  Just 2' N of this position is the planetary Abell 75 which was rediscovered by Abell but not associated with the NGC number.  The ESO-Strausberg planetary catalogue also uses the Abell designation.RNGC lists N7076 as a diffuse nebula instead of a planetary and furthermore the declination is 6' too far S. The ESO-Strausberg catalogue gives a precise 2000 position 21 26 24.1 +62 53 27.

The galaxy identified as N7108 in the RNGC is a virtually stellar galaxy surrounded by several faint stars and located over 20 arcmin following Marth's position and 12' ESE of N7111.  The simplest solution here is to assume a 1.0 min error in RA by Marth, and equate N7108 = N7111Listed as N7108 in the ESGC (Marth has the prior discovery) with N7111 as the secondary ID although either primary ID is justified.

Their discovery positions (precessed to 2000) and descriptions are as follows:N7112  21 42 20 +12 34 47eeF, S, R, pB* with dist companion close p; v diff.N7113  21 42 27 +12 37vF, S, stellThe RNGC and CGCG identify these numbers with the following two galaxies:(R)N7112  21 42 22.9 +12 29 54U11794 = M+02-55-010 = Z427-014(R)N7113  21 42 26.7 +12 34 09M+02-55-009 = Z427-016MCG does not assign a NGC number to the first galaxy but identifies the second galaxy as N7112.Marth's position for N7113 is 3' S of M+02-55-009 but is an exact match in RA.  Swift's RA for N7112 matches M+02-55-010 although his declination would then be 5' off and actually matches N7113.  Furthermore, his description "pB* with dist companion p" applies to N7113 as mag 8.7 SAO 107337 is located 1' preceding.  This bright star also has a "distant companion", which is a mag 13 star 53" ENE.  Finally, if Swift was not aware of Marth's discovery then he most likely recorded the brighter of the pair which is N7113.  So, based on Swift's visual observation it appears likely that N7112 = N7113.************************************************************NGC 7113 = MCG +02-55-009 = CGCG 427-016 = N7112 = PGC 6720821 42 26.6 +12 34 07V = 13.9;  Size 0.9x0.9;  Surf Br = 13.517.5" (9/2/89): faint, small, slightly elongated E-W, weak concentration, faint stellar nucleus.

Just west of the mag 9 star is a 1.5' circular hole with no stars.  A mag 10 star at the extreme west edge has six faint stars mag 13/14 close following.A compact group of faint stars 13' S appears as a small, partially resolved nebulous glow at 100x.  At 220x, 7 stars are resolved from mag 14-15.5 within a 1.5' diameter.

This identification of this galaxy with N7287 is very uncertain and the number may apply to a double star at 22 27 17.2 -22 07 03.Discovered by Muller (II) and described as a "slightly nebulous **."  .  His position is 0.2 tmin W and 4' N of E602-020A.   Identified as a double star by Howe although the seeing was poor.  This galaxy is identified as N7287A = E602-020A in RC3.  ESO equates N7287 with E602-020 which is one magnitude fainter at the identical position as E602-020A.Burnham (Publ of Lick Observatory, II) found two very faint objects about 20" apart although the following one appeared to a faint star only.  I only recorded a single object in my visual observation.Corwin notes N7287 may be a double (or triple) star as Muller originally stated (See NGCBUGS).  But his position falls in a group of galaxies and it may have been the faint galaxy described here (Corwin feels this is less likely).************************************************************NGC 7288 = MCG -01-57-013 = PGC 6893322 28 15.0 -02 53 04V = 13.0;  Size 2.3x1.5;  Surf Br = 14.2;  PA = 92d17.5" (8/7/91): fairly faint, small, well-defined small bright core, bright stellar nucleus, faint halo slightly elongated E-W.************************************************************NGC 7289 = ESO 405-023 = MCG -06-49-006 = PGC 6898022 29 20.0 -35 28 15V = 13.2;  Size 1.4x1.1;  Surf Br = 13.5;  PA = 165d17.5" (7/20/96): faint, fairly small, round, 40" diameter, brighter core.

The bright rim is relatively thick and brightest along the N to NE side within the interior of the annulus (not at the very edge).  A star is embedded at the west edge of this large, enhanced arc.  The opposite SW rim is also enhanced in brightness and thicker.  The rim is weakest and thinnest at the WNW end, but with averted vision this end bulges out due to a faint extension or large filament that begins just south of the western side of the rim and extends north towards a brighter star at the NW edge of the halo.17.5" (10/2/99): gorgeous view at 100x and OIII filter.  This huge, annular PN is 15'x12' in size and slightly elongated E-W due to an extension on the W side.  The thick annulus is mottled and irregular with brighter regions along the N, NE and SW edge.  The W side is slightly weaker but very faint extensions from the N and S side towards the W, cause the rim to bulge on this side.  The west edge of the halo more gradually blends into the background near a mag 11.5 star off the W side.  At 220x without a filter about a dozen stars are superimposed.  The mag 13.5 central star is easy along with a similar star a couple of arcminutes following.13.1" (8/15/82): the "Helix" nebula is extremely large, about 15' diameter, clearly annular.  Significant contrast gain with OIII filter permits observation even from the Bay Area. The fairly bright rim is nonuniform appearing brighter along the N side.  About seven stars are superimposed including the mag 13.5 central star.  Appears best at low power due to size and relative low surface brightness.  Easy in the 80mm finder.8" (10/4/80): huge annular planetary is fairly bright at low power using a Daystar 300 filter.  The rim has an irregular surface brightness.************************************************************NGC 7294 = ESO 533-044 = MCG -04-53-009 = IC 5225 = PGC 6908822 32 08.1 -25 23 52V = 12.5;  Size 1.9x1.2;  Surf Br = 13.3;  PA = 47d17.5" (10/13/90): faint, small, round, bright core.************************************************************NGC 729522 27.9 +52 4917.5" (10/21/95): this asterism consists of ~10 stars including a mag 10 star at the E end and eight mag 12-13 star in an E-W string about 3' length.

His micrometric position and Rosse's offset from N7331 both fall precisely on a mag 14/15 double star at 15" separation with one of the components an extremely close double.  The brighter component has a GSC position 22 36 48.4 +34 22 02 (nonstellar).  Reinmuth lists a "?

On the POSS this galaxy appears to have a fairly bright star superimposed making visual observation extremely difficult.

This object is also identified as a double star by Carlson based on Mount Wilson and Lick Observatory plates.RNGC incorrectly identifies N7326 as CGCG 514-066 which is located 12' NW of N7331.

A possible candidate suggested by Harold Corwin is a mag 13 star near the tip of the northern extension of N7331.  This single star appeared stellar, although it seems plausible that it might look slightly nebulous due to the faint background haze of the galaxy.  Other fainter nearby stars may instead apply to N7327.Discovered by Tempel.  His original description is vague: "preceding the northern end of N7331".  There are no galaxies or double stars nearby, so he may have mistaken a single faint star.  Corwin suggests the mag 13 star at 22 36 57.3 +34 28 02 (2000) as a reasonable candidate in NGCBUGS.  Another possibility is the compact galaxy with a star superimposed which RNGC identifies as NGC 7325, although this is 4' NW of Tempel's positoin.  Unfortunately, Tempel didn't leave any additional clues as to the identification of N7327.

The seeing was fairly poor and observed early in evening before mirror had reached thermal equilibrium.Discovered by Muller (II).  His rough position is 22h 41.5m -22 54 (2000) and description; mag 15.0 (nucleus), 0.3' x 0.1', position angle 175А, binuclear or double.  There is no object at this position but one degree north is E603-G4 = M-04-53-029 located at 22 41 15 -21 47.7 (2000) which is identified as N7349 in ESO and SGC (but not MCG).  Although Muller's declination is considerably off, his PA is very close to the ESO PA = 166А and provides a reliable check.  Corwin concurs with this identification.The RNGC misidentifies N7349 = M-04-53-036 located 3.3 tmin E and 8' S of Muller's place.  Neither galaxy is close to the original position, but the ESO galaxy better fits the visual description.

Perhaps 50 stars are visible within a 15' circle, though the borders are pretty arbitrary.  There are no rich subgroupings although the background contains some unresolved Milky Way background glow.  Does not appear to be eye-catching enough to be mentioned by Herschel and listed as nonexistent in the RNGC.Discovered by John Herschel (h2177): "A star 9-10m, the chief of a p rich, vL, very coarse cluster."  His position corresponds with mag 8.6 SAO 34672 at 22 39 45.7 +57 23 17. Reinmuth describes "a very dense region, Cl not well defined."  Listed as nonexistent in the RNGC.

Can barely hold continuously with averted vision at 220x once identified using GSC chart.  Forms the NE corner of a nearly perfect rhombus with sides 2.7' with three mag 12-14 stars.N7353 is incorrectly identified as UGC 12134 in RNGC although this identification is very uncertain.Discovered by Marth (m493).  There is no galaxy near his discovery position of 22 41 24 +11 56 (2000).  In NGCBUGS, Corwin identified N7353 with NPM1G +11.0547 at 22 42 12.6 +11 52 39 as a probable identification although this galaxy is still 49 tsec E and 3' S (11' ESE) of Marth's position.  This ID is very uncertain due to the discrepancy in positions and there is no entry forN7353 in MCG, CGCG or RC3. Dorothy Carlson lists N7353 as a SBc galaxy (no position given) though it was not found by Reinmuth.U12134 is identified as N7353 in RC3 and RNGC but not UGC.  This galaxy is 1.8 tmin W of Marth's position and also 10' S.

Herschel's position is exactly 1 degree south of E406-006 and this galaxy is identified as N7355 in ESO.  There is also ESO galaxy very close the NGC position but it is 16.8B.  Herschel mentions "a double star follows about 40s on the parallel."  This description matches E406-006 which has a wide pair (mag 10/13) at 30" separation so this identification is nearly certain.

Using the 20" refractor at Chamberlin Observatory, Herbert Howe made a number of micrometric measurements of NGC objects and corrected the position of N7413 14 tsec further east.  This would place N7413 at 22 55 02 +13 13 05 (2000).  This position matches up precisely with MCG +02-58-035 at the GSC position 22 55 03.1 +13 13 14.  Furthermore, there is a string of stars to the SW matching Swift's description.No galaxy exists at either Swift's original position for N7414 or by applying Howe's offset although there are a couple of very faint stars about 2' N of N7413.  Instead, the RNGC has identified N7414 with an extremely small and faint galaxy, NPM1G +12.0575, located 5' ENE of N7413 at 22 55 24.3 +13 14 54 (J2000).  So, N7414 should probably be listed as nonexistent with a possible identification as a faint star.  A visual observation of NPM1G +12.0575 would help to determine if this galaxy was detected by Swift.  Discussed in RNGC Corrections #4.

Incorrectly listed as nonexistent in the RNGC.Discovered by WH (III 745) and observed by JH as h2191 although Dreyer notes in Scientific Papers that their positions differ by about 1 tmin, so the two entries may not refer to the same object. Dreyer used the position of h2191 for the NGC. JH's description reads: "A large patch of the milky way, consisting of stars so small as to be quite nebulous.  If this be not III 745, I find no other."  Listed as nonexistent in RNGC.  Alister Ling notes the equivalence with Be 57.  See NGCBUGS for discussion.Sue French (10-inch): At 115x: hazy patch ~2' nestled in a pattern of mag 11-12 stars as sketched.  Four possible cluster stars visible.

Although clearly shown on the sketch, the 29 Sept 1875 observation states "the object preceding in the 1857 sketch is a faint star, night bad."  Because of this last statement, Thomson feels Dreyer decided to not include this object in the NGC since N7431 is attributed to Bigourdan.  Rosse's object (M+04-54-003 = CGCG 475-006 = PGC 70112) is located 1.5' NW of N7436 and was missed in my 17.5".

This galaxy is not listed in any modern catalogue and the identifications of N7452 and N7459 are not certain due to poor positions by Lewis Swift.Discovered by Swift (II) along with N7459 (and N7455).  His position falls in a small but rich cluster.  RNGC and MCG identify N7452 as the brightest member UGC 12302 = MCG +01-58-021.  This is a double system with nuclei only 10" apart.   Howe apparently also identifies this galaxy as N7452 (MN, Vol 60, 129).Instead, Corwin suggests that N7452 may be an anonymous galaxy at GSC position 23 00 47.5 +06 44 44 (J2000).  This places N7452 21 tsec of RA preceding Swift's position (exact in dec) and roughly matches his offset for N7455 (38 tsec of RA).This also implies N7459 = U12302 which is 12 tsec following (Swift's offset is 20 tsec).  Interestingly, Howe mentioned he suspected another neb preceding by 15 tsec [of the galaxy he identified as N7452].

Located 1.2' W of a mag 13 star.  Forms a pair with N7452 3.1' W.  Listed as nonexistent in RNGC.  This is a double system (not resolved) and brightest in a faint cluster.Discovered by Swift (II) along with N7452.  This number is listed as nonexistent in RNGC and is not identified by Reinmuth. Corwin suggests this number may refer to UGC 12302 = MCG +01-58-021 which RNGC and MCG identify as N7452.  UGC does not give a NGC designation. This is a double system with nuclei only 10" apart.  GSC lists both components at 23 00 59.7 +06 44 58 and 23 01 00.2 +06 45 04.  This is the brightest galaxy in a small but rich group of extremely faint galaxies.Swift's RA is 29 tsec further E (of U12302) and is comparable to his error of 38 tsec for N7455 discovered on the same night.  If this identification is correct, N7452 possibly refers to a previously uncatalogued galaxy 12 tsec of RA further W.Another problem is that the UGC dec for U12302 is 5' too far N and UGC does not give the equivalence with MCG +01-58-021.

This arm dimmed out roughly due west of the star.  The central bar extends 2.4'x0.6' N-S and contains a bulging 25" core that broadly brightens to an occasional faint stellar nucleus with direct vision.  Barely off the N end of the central bar is a mag 12.5 star (1.3' due north of center) and there was just a hint of the north end of the bar starting to bend towards  the east.18" (10/19/06): fairly bright, fairly large, the main bar appears elongated 3:1 N-S, moderately concentrated with a bright core.  A mag 12.5 star is just off the north tip of the bar.  At the south end an extension is generally visible with averted vision hooking back sharply on the west side towards the north.  This spiral arm dims as it hooks but intermittently appears to sweep due north though does not extend as far as the mag 13.5 star off the SW side of the core.17.5" (7/19/90): this is one of few northern barred spirals in which the structure is clearly visible. A bright bar is oriented N-S with a bright core and nearly stellar nucleus. A mag 13 star is off the N edge 1.4' from center and a fainter mag 14 star is 47" SW of center. A thin curving spiral arm attached at the south end curves to the west and then north beyond the mag 14 star SW of the core. This arm parallels the bar along the west side about 90А. At the Sierra Buttes, the spiral arm was held almost continuously with averted vision.

Not knowing the nature of this object, I logged N7486 as "very faint, extremely small, forming a close pair with a mag 15 star" and assumed this observation referred to a very small galaxy.  But on close inspection of the DSS, my "extremely small" object is just two very close mag 15 stars that form a tight triple with the mag 15 star I noted.  Using Lord Rosse's 72", Copeland made the same error.N7485 was observed twice at Birr Castle and the 1871 observation mentions a "D neb f a little s [of N7485]".  In 1876 Copeland again logged this galaxy (GC 6251) as "vF, vS, undoubtedly seen, position angle 109.5А▒ and distance 114"."  This object entered the NGC as N7486.  At this precise offset from N7485 is compact group of 4 faint stars which I also mistook as a nebulous object in my 17.5"!So, the RNGC type of N7486 should be changed to 7 and the new description to "= grp of 4 stars"  GSC lists a pair of mag 15 stars at 6" separation with a mean position of 23 06 13.2 +34 06 11 (2000).  The galaxy identified as N7486 in RNGC is actually N7485.

An extremely faint and close double star ~1.5' SE also appears as a nebulous object at times.  Faintest of five (along with N7558) in HCG 93.This galaxy was probably discovered at Birr Castle although the sketch does not properly place CGCG 454-015, so the NGC identification is uncertain.This object was discovered by the Rosse observers in a group of galaxies with brightest member N7550 = HCG 93A.  Neither Rosse nor Schultz, who also examined the field, gave specific positions for this object so I'm not sure how Dreyer arrived at the NGC position.  A diagram of the field was made at Birr Castle on 6 Oct 1877 and confirmed on 10 Oct 1877 and the four galaxies, N7547, N7549, N7550 and N7553 are shown.  Although the direction of drift shown is somewhat off, it is easy to match the sketch with the POSS except for N7553.  The brightest galaxy near Rosse's position is CGCG 454-015 at 23 15 33 +19 03.0 (2000) and this is the galaxy identified as N7553 in the RNGC.It is certainly possible this was the object seen at Birr Castle (although very faint, it was clearly seen in my 17.5"!) , though the sketch does not match up well with CGCG 454-015 and the indicated position falls closer to an extremely faint star and galaxy at 23 15 38.7 +18 58 25 (2000).  But, this latter object may be too faint to have been picked up visually by Rosse.  Finally, there is a close double star near CGCG 454-015 at 23 15 36.3 +19 01 54 (2000) which is also a possible candidate.************************************************************NGC 7554 = NPM1G -02.0510 = II Zw 99 = PGC 7085023 15 41.3 -02 22 43V = 14.9;  Size 0.4x0.4;  Surf Br = 12.917.5" (7/20/90): very faint, very small, round, low even surface brightness.

The outer envelope is a sharply defined 35"x25" oval, oriented SSW-NNE.  Roughly half-way to the center is a remarkable, thin oval ring oriented SW-NE (slightly offset in orientation compared to the outer shell) of very high surface brightness.  This annular ring is brightest along a 90А arc on the south side and is also enhanced along a shorter arc at the west edge of the northern part of the ring.  The ring fades and appears broken with a gap along the west to WNW edge.  Inside the ring is a darker oval hole that is weakly luminous.18" (10/19/06): In steady seeing, the double-shell structure was remarkable at 807x (7mm Pentax + 2.5x Powermate).  The outer envelope is noticeably oval SW-NE, ~35"x25".  Embedded within this envelope is a fairly thin, very bright inner ring with a sharply defined outline.  The ring was irregular in surface brightness but clearly brightest at the SW and NE ends of the ring (ends of the major axis).  The ring fades on the NW side and there was a small, distinct gap in the ring at the NW end. The surface brightness of the inner ring was high enough to give a glowing "electric" quality with an impression of a rope-like or twisted structure.  The center of the ring was much darker than the ring and formed a substantial dark oval at this magnification, but was still clearly luminous.17.5" (10/13/01): at 500x, this blue high surface brightness planetary has a beautiful double-shell structure with a small, dark center.  The bright inner structure has a delicate, embedded thinner ring of very high surface brightness which is weaker at the following end.  In the center of this ring is a small, darker hole.  The fainter, outer envelope is elongated SW-NE, ~35"x25", giving an asymmetric appearance with the outline of the inner ring.17.5" (10/12/85): extremely bright, very high surface brightness, fairly small, easily takes very high power.  At 410x, the planetary appears weakly annular with a slightly darker center.  There is a second outer shell which exhibits subtle structure due to an irregular surface structure, blue-green color is evident.  Central star not seen.13" (9/11/82): darker center, faint outer shell.8" (9/25/81) : slightly darker center at 300-400x, irregular surface brightness.************************************************************NGC 7663 = MCG -01-59-023 = PGC 7145523 26 45.2 -04 57 59V = 14.5;  Size 0.4x0.417.5" (12/16/95): this observation refers to MCG -01-59-022 which is located 4.4' W of (R)N7663 = MCG -01-59-023.

The identification of this galaxy with N7726 (a Swift discovery) is uncertain although the RNGC has certainly misidentified the number with IC 5342 which lies 2.4' SE of N7720.Discovered by Lewis Swift on 8 Aug 1886 within the rich galaxy cluster Abell 2634.  His discovery position is 23 37 00 +26 42 36 (1950) or 14' ESE of N7720, the brightest member of the cluster.Not found by Bigourdan and there is no object near his position and the RNGC has misidentified N7726 with IC 5342 = CGCG 476-092 which was discovered by Howe and correctly placed at 23 36 08 +26 44.1 (1950).  This galaxy is one of the several very close companions of N7720 and lies just 2.4' SE.As a more plausible candidate, Harold Corwin has suggested N7726 = U12721 = MCG +04-55-040 = CGCG 476-098 at 23 36 41.4 +26 50 18 (1950) which is closer to Swift's position.  This identification is uncertain, though, as Swift mentions a "pB* nr f" and the mag 9 star is actually 9' following altlhough Swift mentioned that N7728 is north-following which does match U12721.In any case, the RNGC identification is certainly incorrect.

RNGC, CGCG and PGC identify N7740 with a much fainter galaxy (CGCG 476-122, 15.6z) located 4.3' NW of 476-123 and missed in my 17.5".  The galaxy identified as N7740 in MCG (+04-55-049) is U12746.Because of the nearly perfect match in coordinates,  it is clear CGCG and RNGC have both misidentified N7740.

A group of stars are involved near the middle and includes a nice isosceles triangle of mag 8/8/9 stars with separations of 2.7', 2.7' and 4' with several fainter stars nearby.  This group is clearly encased in nebulosity and extends to the east for nearly 30' with quite a few stars involved.  Fainter nebulosity also extends to the west in a wide curving lane.  The entire glow shows up well at 12.5x in the 80mm finder.  Did not experiment with filters.17.5" (8/25/95): very faint, very large nebulosity best viewed in the 16x80 finder as it gives a higher contrast with the surrounding sky.  Appears elongated E-W and at least 40' in size.  At 82x, nebulosity is clearly visible in the region of a triangle of mag 8-9 stars including mag 7.9 SAO 20996 at 00 00 57.5 +68 27 27 (2000).  A large portion of the field appears weakly nebulous, though not with certainty.
